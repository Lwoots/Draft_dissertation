# General introduction

The accurate definition of species limits is crucial, since the ability to differentiate between species underpins a diverse range of other fields, from conservation to ecology to medicine. For example, the categorisation and protection of endangered species is often based on species' range and abundance. Thus, incorrect species delimitation may result in poor conservation decisions, and may even determine whether management interventions prevent population decline and extinction [@Chenuil2019]. Human health and safety also depends on accurate species delimitation, with poor species delimitation reducing our ability to prevent disease and develop new medicines. For instance, recent genetic studies have found that several malaria-carrying mosquito species actually comprise of complexes of species that have behavioural differences which warrant unique health interventions [@Stevenson2012; @Lobo2015]. Similarly, the taxonomic instability of venomous snake genera hinders our ability to both create anti-venoms and to explore the potential therapeutic properties of snake venom [@Carrasco2016; @Wuester1996]. Species concepts also underpin our evolutionary hypotheses, our understanding of ecological interactions, and our study of ecosystem function. Until recently, it has been thought that 8.7 million eukaryote species exist on the planet [@Mora2011], but the application of genetic techniques for species delimitation suggests that there may be far more, predominantly due to the discovery of cryptic species [@Scheffers2012; @Adams2014; @Struck2018].

Cryptic species are species which are morphologically similar, but genetically distinct [@Struck2018]. Often, cryptic species are initially classified as a single taxon, only to be found to consist of two or more unique species [@Pfenninger2007; @Bickford2007]. Despite similarities in their appearance, cryptic species have been shown to play different functional and ecological roles [@Meester2016], preferring different microhabitats [@Guden2018], and requiring unique environmental tolerances [@Meester2011]. Taxonomists have traditionally described species on the basis of morphology, differences in morphology being taken as evidence of reproductive isolation, an important criterion for species delimitation under the Biological Species Concept [@Mayr1942]. However, the genetic distinctness of morphologically similar taxa implies that mate recognition techniques, such as calls, smells, and colour spectra which we are unable to see, may be equally important in reproductive isolation. In recent years, cryptic species have been discovered in abundance across all taxa and biomes [@Pfenninger2007, @Beheregaray2007; @Janzen2017]. For example, nearly 60% of recently described mammalian species are from cryptic complexes [@Ceballos2009], including in charismatic taxa such as giraffes and elephants [@Brown2007; @Roca2001]. However, there is a bias in cryptic species research, with many studies being conducted on marine meiofauna, but few in plants and even less in fungi and insects, among others [@Bickford2007]. 

The origin of cryptic species is evolutionarily intriguing, but understudied. Nonethless, several different mechanisms that could cause cryptic speciation have been postulated to date. A commonly cited explanation for cryptic species is that such species are young [@Knowlton1993; @Reidenbach2012]. If sister species have recently diverged from their common ancestor, insufficient time may have passed for the species to have accumulated noticeable phenotypic differences [@Struck2019]. Alternatively, cryptic species may be generated under convergent or parallel evolution [@Tang2019], where unrelated species evolve a similar morphology due to shared environmental pressures. For example, @Swift2016 found that jellyfish species from distantly related ancestors converged on the same morphology after moving from a marine environment to a lake environment. Finally, species may undergo stasis, where their morphology remains unchanged for millions of years despite substantial genetic divergence [@Wada2013; @Struck2019]. Stasis due to stabilising selection can occur when strong environmental drivers cause a single phenotype to be strongly advantageous. Morphological stasis may also be a consequence of niche conservatism [@Wiens2004]. Species exhibiting niche conservatism track suitable habitat, rather than adapting to environmental variability, thus ecological change may result in habitat fragmentation, population isolation, and, ultimately, vicariant speciation  [@Kozak2006]. This process is known as non-ecological speciation, because species split not in response to divergent selection, but as a consequence of neutral processes such as genetic drift [@Rundell2009].

The Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) is a hotspot of biological diversity, containing over 11,000 plant species, despite its relatively small size [@Goldblatt2002; @Myers2000; @Snijman2013]. The richness of the Cape flora is due, firstly, to the environmental heterogeneity of the GCFR, which contains highly variable soil characteristics [@Cramer2019], complex rainfall patterns, and a rugged topography, with the Cape Fold mountains extending into the north and east of the GCFR, and rising to 2249 m at their highest [@Manning2012]. The environmental heterogeneity facilitates speciation both by providing gradients along which ecological speciation can occur [@Linder1985], but also by providing a mosaic of habitats which promote differentiation by non-ecological divergence [@Verboom2015]. Secondly, a comparatively stable climate through the Pleistocene is thought to have promoted diversity by reducing extinction [@Dynesius2000]. However, the region increased in aridity during the late-Miocene, which has been attributed to a combination of factors, including the development of the Benguela Upwelling system, changes in Antarctic glaciation and the tectonic uplift of the Eastern rim of southern Africa [@Siesser1980; @Zachos2001; @Dupont2011; @Rommerskirchen2011]. By completely transforming the lowland habitats of the Cape [@Hoffmann2015], such change may have created opportunities for adaptive radiation [@Verboom2003; @Verboom2015]. However, such change may also have prompted isolation of montane habitats, thereby providing a stimulus for non-ecological speciation [@Forest2007; @Britton2014]. 

The high-elevation region of the GCFR leads itself to non-ecological speciation, as it is archipelagic in nature, the mountain peaks can be considered as climatically isolated and geologically distinct islands surrounded by a 'sea' of lowland habitat. Many of the GCFR species that occur at high-elevations have small ranges, and sister species often display strong range exclusivity [@Verboom2015], which is characteristic of species generated through non-ecological speciation [@Kozak2006; @Boucher2016; @CzekanskiMoir2019]. High-elevation clades in the GCFR have also been shown to diversify within their elevational band [@Verboom2015], and not solely as a result of the Late-Miocene aridification. Consequently, it has been suggested that the relative importance of ecological and non-ecological speciation processes may vary with elevation in the GCFR, with primarily ecological speciation occurring at low- to mid-elevations, and with non-ecological speciation dominating at high-elevations [@Verboom2015]. If this is indeed true, low-elevation clades that diversified via adaptive radiations should show a higher rate of phenotypic and molecular evolution than high-elevation clades. In addition, high-elevation lineages should exhibit similar morphologies, small ranges, and phylogenetically conserved ecological niches [@Kozak2006; @CzekanskiMoir2019]. There are already case studies illustrating the potential prevalence of non-ecological speciation in the montane regions. For example, @Britton2014 found that the high-elevation Cape sedge, _Tetraria triangularis_, consisted of multiple, ecologically similar cryptic species. Similarly, topographically isolated white _Protea_ populations exhibit limited geneflow between populations which might qualify as distinct evolutionary species [@Prunier2010]. If non-ecological speciation is indeed the dominant mode of speciation at high-elevations, it is possible that the GCFR is even more diverse than previously thought, with a host of cryptic species potentially waiting to be discovered within the montane regions.

The Cape grass genus _Ehrharta_ Thunb. represents an ideal model system with which to test whether speciation processes vary with elevation in the GCFR. The genus currently consists of approximately 45 taxa (species and subspecies) and has a Gondwanan distribution, with species occurring in Australasia, New Zealand, Malesia, Reunion, Madagascar and Africa. The majority of species, however, form a GCFR-endemic clade which comprises a core low-elevation clade that is subtended by a grade of mid- to high-elevation lineages [@GibbsRussell1987; @Verboom2003]. This low-elevation clade, which associates primarily with renosterveld and succulent karoo scrub habitats, has been shown to have undergone an adaptive radiation in response to the Late Miocene aridification, and has been interpreted as the primary radiation in _Ehrharta_ [@Verboom2003; @Verboom2004]. However, although the mid- and high- elevation lineages of Cape _Ehrharta_ comprise just six species in total, four of these species contain multiple subspecies. In addition, field observations suggest that there may be more subtle morphological differentiation in the high-elevation clades than current taxonomy suggests. Therefore _Ehrharta_ offers the opportunity both to test for the existence of multiple, range restricted cryptic species at high elevations, and to assess explicitly the relative importance of neutral versus adaptive processes in powering speciation at low versus high elevations.
