# Introduction to the dissertation

The accurate definition of species limits is crucial, as the ability to differentiate between species underpins a diverse range of other fields, from conservation to ecology to medicine. For example, the categorisation and protection of endangered species are often based the species' range and abundance. If the species is wrongly defined, the resulting conservation decisions will be made on incorrect information, and may determine whether or not species management prevents population decline or even extinction (@Chenuil2019). Human health and safety also depends on clear species boundaries. Poor species delimitation reduces our ability to prevent disease and develop new medicines. For example, recent genetic studies have found that several malaria-carrying mosquito species are actually species complexes with behavioural differences that warrant unique health interventions (@Stevenson2012, @Lobo2015). Similarly, the taxonomic instability of venomous snake genera hinder our ability to both create anti-venoms and to explore the potential therapeutic properties of snake venom (Carrasco2016, Wuster1996). Species also underpin our evolutionary hypotheses, our understanding ecological interactions, and our study of ecosystem function. Currently, it is thought that 8.7 million species exist on the planet (@Mora2011), but the recent rise in genetic techniques for species delimitation suggests that there may be far more, predominantly due to hidden taxa known as cryptic species (@Scheffers2012, @Adams2014, @Struck2018). 

Cryptic species are morphologically similar, but genetically distinct taxa (@Struck2018). Often, cryptic species are initially classified as a single species, only to be found to consist of two or more unique taxa (@Pfenninger2007, @Bickford2007). Despite their similarities in appearance, cryptic species have been shown to play different functional and ecological roles (nematode paper). Taxonomists have traditionally described species based on morphology, as differences in appearance imply reproductive isolation, an important criterion for species delimitation under the Biological Species Concept (Mayr). However, the genetic distinctness of morphologically similar taxa implies that mate recognition techniques, such as calls, smells, and colour spectra that we are unable to see, may be equally important in reproductive isolation. Cryptic species are being discovered in abundance across all taxa and biomes. For example, nearly 60% of recently described mammalian species are from cryptic complexes (@Ceballos2009). However, there is a bias in cryptic species research, as many studies have been conducted on marine tiny creatures, and few in plants (@Bickford2007). 

The origin of cryptic species is both evolutionarily intriguing and understudied. Several different mechanisms that could cause cryptic speciation have been postulated to date. A commonly cited mechanism is that cryptic species are young (ref). If sister species have recently diverged from their common ancestor, not enough time may have passed for the species to have accumulated noticeable phenotypic differences (@Struck2019). Alternatively, cryptic species may be generated under convergent or parallel evolution (@Tang2019), where unrelated species evolve a similar morphology due to shared environmental pressures. For example, @Swift2016 found that jellyfish species from distantly related ancestors converged on the same morphology after moving from a marine environment to a lake environment. Finally, species may undergo stasis, where their morphology remains unchanging for millions of years despite extensive genetic divergence (@Wada2013, @Struck2019). Stasis due to stabilising selection can occur when strong environmental drivers cause a single phenotype to be strongly advantageous. Morphological stasis may also be a result of niche conservatism. Here, species track suitable habitat, rather than adapting to environmental variation. Widespread ecological change may result in suitable habitat becoming isolated, reducing geneflow between populations and creating vicariant species (@Kozak2006). This process is known as non-ecological speciation, as species diverge not in response to selection, but due to neutral processes such as genetic drift (@Rundell2009). Niche conservatisim may be follwed later sympatry, if species secondarily expand their original range to encompass that of closely related taxa. 

Elaborate on adaptive vs non adaptive here?

The Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) is a hotspot of biological diversity, with over 9000 species despite its relatively small size (@Manning&Goldblatt2012, @Myers2017). The prevailing explanation for the wealth of plant species is adaptive ecological speciation, driven by both historical and current conditions in the Cape. During the mid-Miocene, the Cape was far less arid, and supported a tropical, moisture-dependent flora (@Linder2003, @Dupont2011). However, the region shifted to a more arid, winter-rainfall system during the late-Miocene, which has been attributed to a combination of factors, including the development of the Benguela Upwelling system, changes in Antarctic glaciation and the tectonic uplift of the Eastern rim of southern Africa (@Siesser1980, @Zachos2001, @Dupont2011, @Rommerskirchen2011). The increased aridification triggered speciation events in many GCFR clades (Dupont2011, Verboom2009). In addition to the past climatic changes, a variety of ecological gradients exist in the present day. The rugged Cape Fold mountains extend into the north and east of the GCFR, and rise to 2249 m at their highest. Climatic conditions become increasingly wet and cool towards the summits, creating strong moisture gradients along the mountain slopes. Coupled with highly variable soil characteristics (@Cramer2019), the variety of selective environments in the GCFR makes it unsurprising that ecological speciation is often cited as a driver of species richness in the region (@Thullier2006, @VanderNiet2009, @Schnitzler2012). 

However, recent literature has postulated a role for non-ecological speciation in mountainous  driving species diversification in the GCFR. The same scenario of aridification with the retention of moist habitats at high elevations is suitable for vicariant speciation via niche conservatism. Non-ecological speciation has been acknowledged as an important diversification process in other mountainous regions, such as the Alps



As species track their preferred habitat up mountain slopes, populations can became isolated in their high-elevation refugia. The reduced geneflow between the isolated populations promotes gradual divergence through genetic drift, eventually leading to non-ecological, vicariant speciation. It is thought that species created via this process tend to have similar morphologies and  Non-ecological speciation has also been acknowledged as an important diversification process in other mountainous regions, such as the Alps

 It is therefore possible that the cape is even more diverse than previously thought, potentially with a host of cryptic species occuring at high elevations. 

Yet, over 30% of these species are contained in just 11 clades (Linder 2003). 



The cape is species rich

Adaptive speciation prevailing explanation

The Cape grass genus _Ehrharta_ is an ideal model to study drivers of speciation in the CFR. It contains low-, mid-, and high-elevation clades, allowing hypothesis testing. The mid-elevation clade _E. ramosa_ and _E. rehmannii_ are widely distributed and can tolerate more arid environments. The lowland Namaqua clade has already been shown to have undergone an adaptive radiation in response to XXX, which was thought to be the primary radiation in _Ehrharta_. However, although the the mid and high elevation clades consist of just four species, each species contains multiple subspecies. In addition, field observations have shown that there may be more subtle morphological differences than current taxonomy suggests. Therefore _Ehrharta_ can be used to both test differing rates of evolution between clades, and potentially look for cryptic species.
