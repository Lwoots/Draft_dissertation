# Introduction to the dissertation

Accurately defined species limits are important in many spheres of life. For example, categorisation and protection of endangered species are often based the species' range and abundance. Inconsistencies in species delimitation will mean that these conservation decisions are made on incorrect information, and may determine whether or not species management prevents extinction (@Chenuil2019). This impacts everything from endangered species to fishing stocks. Human health and safety also depends clear species boundaries. For example, incorrect species descriptions can impede the creation of new medicines biopharmacy, as in this example. It also decreases efficiency to find effective treatments, for example malaria vectors are different species, warranting different treatments (@Lobo2015), or toxicology, as in this examples.. In the research field, species underpin the results of evolutionary hypotheses, our understanding ecological interactions, and our study of ecosystem function. Currently, it is thought that 8.7 million species exist on the planet (@Mora2011), but the recent rise in genetic techniques for species delimitation suggests that there may be far more, predominantly due to hidden taxa known as cryptic species (@Scheffers2012, @Adams2014, @Struck2018). 

Cryptic species are morphologically similar, but genetically distinct taxa (@Struck2018). Often, cryptic species are classified as a single species, only to be found to consist of two or more unique taxa (@Pfenninger2007, @Bickford2007). Despite their similarities in appearance, cryptic species have been shown to play different functional and ecological roles. Taxonomists have traditionally described species based on morphology, as differences in morphology imply reproductive isolation, an important criterion for species delimitation under the Biological Species Concept (Mayr). However, the genetic distinctness of morphologically similar taxa shows that mate recognition techniques such as calls, smells, and colour spectra that we are unable to see may be equally important in reproductive isolation. Cryptic species are being discovered in abundance across all taxa and biomes. For example, nearly 60% of recently described mammalian species are from cryptic complexes (@Ceballos2009). However, there is a bias in cryptic species research, as most studies have been conducted on marine and zoo things, and few in plants (@Bickford2007). 

The generation of cryptic species is both evolutionarily intriguing and understudied. Several different mechanisms have been postulated to date. A commonly cited mechanism is that cryptic species are young. If sister species have recently diverged from their common ancestor, not enough time may have passed for the species to have accumulated noticeable phenotypic differences. Alternatively, cryptic species may be generated under convergent or parallel evolution, where unrelated species evolve a similar morphology due to shared environmental pressures. For example, @Swift2016 found that jellyfish species from distantly related ancestors converged on the same morphology after moving from a marine environment to a lake environment. Finally, species may undergo stasis, where morphology remains unchanging for millions of years. Stasis may be due to stabilising selection, where there are strong environmental drivers making a single phenotype strongly advantageous. Alternatively, morphological stasis may be a result of niche conservatism. Species track suitable habitat, and widespread ecological change may result in suitable habitat becoming isolated, reducing geneflow between species and creating vicariant species. This is known as non-adaptive speciation, as species diverge not in response to selection, but due to neutral processes such as drift. 

the species complex may be undergoing neutral evolution, where geographic isolation followed by stable environments result in a gradual drift in genetic similarity.  

 Speciation studies have tended to concentrate on adaptive radiations, where selective pressures create large changes in morphology which are accompanied by rapid genetic changes. Arguably, the reverse is equally interesting. Why would some species maintain the same morphology while diverging genetically?

 ways of generating cryptic species (@Struck2019): recent divergence, convergence, parallelism and stasis

recent speciation = not enough time to generate morph differences, maybe bse selection is focusing on behavioural/physiological/etc traits



convergence/parallelism = same phenotype evolved independently

stasis = no morphological change over prolonged length of time (stablizing selection, lack of genetic diversity, niche tracking, developmental constraints)

neutral - genetic drift in isolated populations





Directional selection on ecological, behavioral, or reproductive traits that have no observed morphological correlates might foster cryptic speciation and be a mechanism that drives cryptic diversification(@Bickford2007)



We support recent arguments

that the long-term stability of an ecological niche has

profound consequences for the build-up of species

diversity because it causes species to track their preferred

habitats in the face of environmental change, promoting

vicariant fragmentation and formation of new evolutionary

lineages (@Kozak2006)
