# Introduction to the dissertation

Accurately defined species limits are important in many spheres of life. Categorisation and protection of endangered species are often based the species' range and abundance. on conservation decisions Conservation decisions are made based and inconsistencies in species delimitation will impact the true abundance and range of a species, and may determine whether a species goes extinct. Human health and safety also depends clear species boundaries. For example, incorrect species descriptions can impact production of medicine, as in this example, or toxicology, as in this examples. It also decreases efficiency to find cures, eg malaria vectors (@Lobo2015). In the research field, species underpin the results of evolutionary hypotheses, our understanding of biodiversity generation, and our study of ecosystem function. Currently, it is thought that 8.7 million species exist on the planet (@Mora2011), but the recent rise in genetic techniques for species delimitation suggests that there may be far more, due to hidden taxa known as cryptic species (@Scheffers2012, @Adams2014, @Struck2018). 

Cryptic species are morphologically similar, but genetically distinct taxa (@Struck2018). Often, cryptic species are classified as a single species, only to be found to consist of two or more unique taxa (@Pfenninger2007, @Bickford2007). Taxonomists traditionally describe species based on morphology, as differences in morphology imply reproductive isolation, an important criteria for species delimitation under the Biological Species Concept (Mayr). However, the genetic distinctness of morphologically similar taxa shows that mate recognition techniques such as calls, smells, and colour spectra that we are unable to see may be equally important in reproductive isolation. Cryptic species are being discovered in abundance across all taxa and biomes. Nearly 60% of recently described species are considered cryptic. However, most studies in marine creatures and zoo things, much less in plants. 



Very important to describe all cryptic species as affects conservation, ecological and evolutionary understanding, human vectors (@Chenuil2019).
