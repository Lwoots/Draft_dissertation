Intro to species delimitation

## Cryptic species are tricky



The definition of a species is a controversial topic in biodiversity science. There is no single criterion that satisfactorily defines a species across all living organisms (Mayden). De Queiroz 2007 realised that the dissonance between species definitions was due to the speciation process itself. As a lineage separates and diverges into two, it accumulates differences in morphology, genetic composition, ecology and degree of reproductive isolation. However, these differences can appear in different order or not at all, depending on the taxon, creating a grey zone in the speciation process where it is unclear whether or not the lineages constitute separate species. It became clear that the heterogeneity in the speciation process meant that using a single criterion to delimit a species was insufficient. A new, holistic paradigm of taxonomy, called integrative taxonomy (Dayrat, Padial), was proposed to create more robust species limits. Integrative taxonomy emphasises that multiple lines of evidence should be examined before delimiting a species. Despite the extensive implementation of integrative taxonomy, morphology remains one of the most important criteria for species delimitation, especially for plant taxa. This is due to concerns that over-reliance on genetic data leads to unwarranted splitting of taxa (Coates2018). Few species have been described solely on genetic data (Jorger?). The morphologically similar cryptic species therefore challenging to delimit. 



Several recent studies have tried to generate integrative taxonomy protocols for cryptic species (@Brown2013, @struck2018, @Singhal2019, @Fiser2018, @Chaplin2019). Firstly, extensive sampling along the entirety of the complex's range is needed to get a clear idea of genetic relationships and gene flow. This prevents spurious splits between populations that appear to be genetically isolated but are actually joined by intermediatrary populations. Secondly, strong genetic differentiation needs to be demonstrated between putative cryptic species. This differentiation should be genome wide, to avoid barcoding errors.  Commonly used methods include distance based methods, eg, tree based methods, eg, and coalescent methods. Ideally more than one of these should be used, and should back each other up. Thirdly, after genetic analysis, morphology should be re-examined to see if anything appears. Fourthly, reproductive isolation should ideally be shown through sympatry, crossing experiments  



1)Extensive population level sampling





1) Genetic differentiation

- genome wide
- Well sampled at pop level to find limits
- Tree, distance, coalescent model

2) Post-hoc Re-examination of morphology based on genetic clusters

* Microscopy 
* Finescale characters

3) Evidence of reproductive isolation

* sympatry
* crossing experiments
* introgression
* contact zones

4) Calibration methods

* Rates 



Species descriptions are traditionally based on morphology. The biological species concept of Mayr required reproductive isolation, and morphology has been used as a proxy for rep iso. The more different the appearance, the more likely that taxa can't interbreed. This did not suit all taxa, and a plethora of other species concepts were published. However, De Queiroz highlighted the need for evo lineages along with DNA advances  









Can't tell them apart.

Important to be accurate bse don't want taxominic inflation (@Korshunova2019)

Para 1. Species conceptualization, cryptic/semicryptic species and challenges of cryptic species delimitation



@Tang2019 

1) Difficulties of defining species, many different species concepts, 

@Dequeiroz2007 unified them, emphasises evo lineages plus recently holistic approach called integrative taxonomy @Dayrat @Padial

Plant systematists concentrate on morphology\



What constitutes a species has been a long running debate.  De Queiroz showed that all species concepts had a criterion in common - that a species is an independently evolving lineage. What differed between the concepts was how early in the divergence process a species was called unique. 



The lack of morphological characters to distinguish cryptic species should not lead to considerable parts of biological diversity remaining unaddressed @jorger2013 Delimitation needs sampling across range to find boundary of species





Para 2. Criteria/methodological approaches for delimiting cryptic/semicryptic species

Barcoding often used - how much difference = new species, + do not provide a comprehensive assessment of gene flow and reproductive isolation. @struck2018 need genome wide data

@Chenuil, @Korshunova @Jorger



@Struck - No genetic admixture, but morphological overlap



What you need:

Genome wide data that shows strong differentiation

Well sampled at pop level to find limits

Ideally evidence of sympatry to demonstrate rep iso, otherwise crossing experiments

Re examination of morphology to see if fine scale differences

Age of taxa

Rate of trait evolution

Niche equivalency
