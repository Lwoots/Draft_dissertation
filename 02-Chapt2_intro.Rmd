# Chapt 2 intro

The definition of a species has been a controversial topic in biodiversity science. There is no single criterion that satisfactorily defines a species across all living organisms (@Mayden1997, @Queiroz2005). De Queiroz 2007 realised that the dissonance between species definitions was due to the speciation process itself. As a lineage separates and diverges into two, it accumulates differences in morphology, genetic composition, ecology and degree of reproductive isolation. However, these differences can appear in different order or not at all, depending on the taxon, creating a grey zone in the speciation process (@Queiroz1998). While most contemporary species concepts accept that a species is an independently evolving lineage (@Queiroz2007), determining when speciation has occurred in the gradual divergence of two lineages remains difficult. 

It became clear that the heterogeneity in the speciation process meant that using a single criterion to delimit a species was insufficient (@Wiley1978, @Frost1995, @Queiroz2005, @Padial2008) . A new, holistic paradigm of taxonomy, called integrative taxonomy (@Dayrat2005, @Padial2010), was proposed to inform more robust species limits. Integrative taxonomy emphasises that multiple lines of genetic, morphological, phylogenetic and ecological evidence should be examined before delimiting and describing a species (@Dayrat2005, @Padial2010). Despite the extensive implementation of integrative taxonomy (Dayrat's 2005 paper has been cited nearly 1400 times to date), morphology remains one of the most important criteria for species delimitation, especially for plant taxa (@Rouhan2014, @Treurnicht2017). This is due to concerns that over-reliance on genetic data leads to taxonomic inflation (@Isaacs2004, @Coates2018, ref) Morphologically similar cryptic plant species therefore present a challenge to delimit. Molecular barcoding was initially touted as a solution to circumscribe obscure species, but proved to have several issues, including taxonomic decisions made on arbitrary genetic differences, the inappropriate resolution of barcoding genes for certain taxa, and difficulties of linking new DNA sequences to existing type specimens (@Tautz2003, @Moritz2004, @DeSalle2005, @Goulding2015). 

Several recent studies have instead created integrative taxonomy protocols for delimitation of cryptic species, which have several criteria in common (@Brown2013, @Jorger13, @Singhal2019, @Fiser2018, @Chaplin2019). Firstly, extensive sampling along the entirety of a species complex's range is needed to get a clear idea of genetic relationships and gene flow. This prevents spurious splits between populations that appear to be genetically isolated, but are actually joined by intermediary populations. Next, strong genetic differentiation needs to be demonstrated between putative cryptic species. This differentiation should be shown in data that incorporate independently evolving regions of the genome, to ensure that variation in gene histories from different loci is represented (@Fujita2012). Commonly used ways of testing genetic differentiation include distance-based methods, where species are delimited if intraspecific genetic variation is less than interspecific variation (@Puillandre2012), tree-based methods, and coalescent methods (@Leache2014). Ideally, more than one of these approaches should be used for corroboration. After genetic analysis, morphology should be re-examined to potentially find subtle traits that support the genetic findings (@Chaplin). Finally, reproductive isolation should ideally be demonstrated through the existence of sympatric populations, or through crossing experiments if possible (@Singhal2019).  

Subspecies are meant to represent incipient species, typically geographically isolated variants that have started to diverge morphologically from the remainder of the species' populations (@Mayr1982).  As with species concepts, there there have been numerous attempts to define what constitutes a subspecies without reaching consensus (@Wilson1958, @Pattern2002). The rank is instead usually applied to a taxon based on the opinion of the taxonomist (@Thorpe1987, @Hawlitschek2012). The use of subspecies was particularly popular during the first half of the 1900's, where any minor morphological pattern or geographic disjunction was considered sufficient to be given subspecific status (@Mayr1982, @Manier2004). During this time, nearly 50% of previously named bird species were demoted to subspecies (@Zink2004). Its usage declined when it was discovered that many allopatric distributions were merely artefacts of poor geographic sampling, that subspecies boundaries were often at arbitrarily chosen locations, or that the subspecies had little genetic basis (@Mayr1982, @Thorpe1984, @Zink2004, @Philimore2006, @Burbrink2000). Many taxonomists now avoid using the rank, arguing that subspecies are either poorly differentiated species that should be treated as such, or represent local variation that does not warrant a taxonomic rank (@Burbrink2000, @Manier2004). On the other hand, it can be argued that subspecies are useful for conservation (@Haig2006, @Pattern2015), highlights interesting variation that can inform questions on local adaption, migration and dispersal (@Pattern2002), and alerts future researchers to the possibility that there may be hidden species that could be revealed with new data (@Frost1992, @Mulcahy2007). 







1)Extensive population level sampling





1) Genetic differentiation

- genome wide
- Well sampled at pop level to find limits
- Tree, distance, coalescent model

2) Post-hoc Re-examination of morphology based on genetic clusters

* Microscopy 
* Finescale characters

3) Evidence of reproductive isolation

* sympatry
* crossing experiments
* introgression
* contact zones

4) Calibration methods

* Rates 



Species descriptions are traditionally based on morphology. The biological species concept of Mayr required reproductive isolation, and morphology has been used as a proxy for rep iso. The more different the appearance, the more likely that taxa can't interbreed. This did not suit all taxa, and a plethora of other species concepts were published. However, De Queiroz highlighted the need for evo lineages along with DNA advances

Para 1. Species conceptualization, cryptic/semicryptic species and challenges of cryptic species delimitation



@Tang2019 

1) Difficulties of defining species, many different species concepts, 

@Dequeiroz2007 unified them, emphasises evo lineages plus recently holistic approach called integrative taxonomy @Dayrat @Padial

Plant systematists concentrate on morphology\



What constitutes a species has been a long running debate.  De Queiroz showed that all species concepts had a criterion in common - that a species is an independently evolving lineage. What differed between the concepts was how early in the divergence process a species was called unique. 



The lack of morphological characters to distinguish cryptic species should not lead to considerable parts of biological diversity remaining unaddressed @jorger2013 Delimitation needs sampling across range to find boundary of species





Para 2. Criteria/methodological approaches for delimiting cryptic/semicryptic species

Barcoding often used - how much difference = new species, + do not provide a comprehensive assessment of gene flow and reproductive isolation. @struck2018 need genome wide data

@Chenuil, @Korshunova @Jorger



@Struck - No genetic admixture, but morphological overlap



What you need:

Genome wide data that shows strong differentiation

Well sampled at pop level to find limits

Ideally evidence of sympatry to demonstrate rep iso, otherwise crossing experiments

Re examination of morphology to see if fine scale differences

Age of taxa

Rate of trait evolution

Niche equivalency 



Para 3. Subspecies as poorly differentiated species
