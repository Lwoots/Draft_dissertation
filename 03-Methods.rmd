# Methods

## Library preparation

**Quantus** (QuantusTM fluorometer, Promega corporation, Madison USA) using (QuantiFluorR dsDNA System, Promega corporation, Madison USA)

\-    Dye = 1990 ul 1X TE buffer 10ul dye

\-    Blank = 100ul 1X TE buffer, 100 ul dye

\-    Std = 98 ul 1X TE buffer, 100 ul dye, 2 ul dna standard

\-    Samples = 99 ul TE buffer, 100 ul dye, 1 ul sample

Gives reading of DNA concentration

 

**Dilution**

Need 200 ng DNA in 26 ul liquid. Liquid used was MilliQ water to dilute our TE buffer elute a bit.

Calculations: Vol sample used = 200/quantus concentration. MilliQ water added = 26 ul – vol sample used.

 

**Sonication** (Covaris Focused-ultrasonicator M220, software Covaris SonoLabTM 2013 Version 7.2.1.0, Woburn Massachusetts 01801 www.covarisinc.com)

Transfer diluted sample into covaris tubes

Sonicated for 75 secs @ temp of between 18 and 20C

Avg Incident power 10 Watts, Peak Incident power 50W, Duty factor 20%, cycles/burst 200)

Aiming for 350 bp

 

**LIBRARY PREPARATION**

NEBNxet Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina. New England Biolabs inc.

Note: We were using half the recommended reagent quantities with the same amount of DNA (200ng)

www.neb.com

 

**End Prep** repairing torn ends after sonication

Kit enzymes and buffer added. In thermocycler for 30 mins @ 20C and 30 mins @ 65C

 

**Adapter ligation** adds adapters to the repaired ends

Add master mix and ligation enhancer

In thermocycler for 15 mins @ 20C

 

**USER,** in previous step adapters attach to the ends of two different strands, USER enzymes cuts the adapters in half 

In thermocycler for 15 mins @ 37C

 

**Size selection of DNA fragments**

Add 13 ul AMPure magnetic beads to 95 ul of the library. Should bind to long fragments. Discard the beads with the long fragments and keep supernatant. Add 5ul beads to supernatant. All dna except shortest fragments should bind to the beads. Discard supernatant. Wash and re elute beads in 10mM tris.

 

**PCR enrichment**

 

Clean pipettes and bench with bleach 

Add master mix from kit and two different index primers – i7 and i5

NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (Dual Index Primer Set 1) #E7600S New England Biolabs Inc. 

 

Thermocycler conditions

 

Initial denaturation - 30s @ 98C

 

Denaturation – 10s @ 98C

Annealing/Extension – 75s @ 65C

Repeat above for 7 or 8 cycles 

 

Final extension – 5 mins @ 65C

 

**Clean up of PCR amplification**

 

Add 22.5 ul Ampure magnetic beads to sample.

Discard supernatant and wash beads with 80% ethanol

Elute beads in 16.5 ul 10mM tris.

Transfer 15.5 ul supernantant to new well.

 

**Library quality check**

 

Quantus as above for library concentration

 

Check fragment size distribution using Agilent Technologies 4200 Tapestation

And Agilent Technologies 4200 Tapestation Controller software A.02.02 (SR1)

\+ get average fragment size using the region tool in Agilent Technologies 4200 Tapestation Analysis software A.02.02 (SR1)

Using DS1000 tapes

3 ul buffer from kit + 1 ul sample. Vortex and spin down. Ladder from kit.

 

Aiming for a library concentration of 4 ng/ul and avg fragment size of 450.

In reality mine were much more concentrated with a frag size of ~500

 

If libraries failed, either rePCR, re size selected, or redo from the beginning.

rePCR – primers Universal primers P05 and P07 from bait kit.

 

 

**SEQUENCING PREPARATION**

 

**Normalising samples**

 

All libraries need to be at a concentration of 10 nM.

Calculate current molarity: (Lib. Conc)/(Avg. frag size * 660) *1000000

(The 660 is the average molecular weight of a base pair)

 

Add 5 ul of sample to a well.

Calculate the amount of water needed to dilute to 10 nM with (lib. Molarity – 10)/2

 

**Pooling samples**

 

I didn’t have to worry about pooling by relatedness or quality as all mine were pretty similar.

 

Add 10 ul of 24 samples (12 samples in the case of the MiSeq) to a 1.5 ml epi. Vac dry for 30-40 mins in miVac DUO concentrator (genevac)

 

Elute in 8 ul of 10 mM tris

 

**HYBRIDISATION**

 

Kit used:

**Reaction assembly**

 

Mix together Hyb reagents and baits

Mix together blocks

 

Add libraries to block mixture

Incubate at 95C for 5 mins

 

Bring hybridization mixture to 95C

**Clean up**

**Prep for MiSeq**

 

Normalise to 4mM (My library was pretty much there anyway at 3.8 mM, so skipped this step)

 

Dilute 2M NaOH to 0.2M NaOH

 

Add 5ul library to 5ul NaOH (denaturing)

 

Add 990 Hyb buffer from illumina kit

 

Take 330 ul of that solution and dilute it with 270 ul more buffer to make a 11 pM solution.

 

Load into MiSeq



## Phylogenetic methods



**Read trimming and quality control**

The raw reads were cleaned and trimmed from the dataset using trimmomatic V0.39 (ref). First, Illuminaclip palindrome mode using the reference file TruSeq3-PE.fa removed Illumina sequencing adaptors. Palindrome mode had the following settings: SeedMismatches = 1, palindromeClipThreshold = 30, simpleClipThreshold = 6, minAdapterLength  =  2; keepBothReads = T RUE.  Second, poor quality reads were trimmed with the Maxinfo option. Maxinfo balances the utility of retaining reads of an informative length against the costs of incorrect bases. Initially, Maxinfo is lenient towards potential error calls at a shorter read length, and becomes more strict as read length increases. The settings used were targetLength = 40 and strictness = 85. Finally, reads shorter than 36 bases were removed using MinLength. Overall read quality and adaptor content of the remaining reads were checked using FastQC 0.11.8 (ref)



**Read assembly**

Reads were assembled using the pipeline HybPiper 1.3.1 (ref).  HybPiper consists of a series of python scripts that use SPAdes (ref) and other bioinfomatic tools to assemble reads to a target file. In the case of a multi-species target file, HybPiper can determine which target sequence for a gene is the most suitable given the sample. The pipeline first sorts and groups together individual reads for a gene by mapping the reads to the gene sequence in the target file. The reads are mapped using either BLASTx or bwa. Once the reads are sorted by gene, they are de novo assembled using SPAdes.The pipeline was run using BLAST to recover the coding genes that matched a multi-species target
