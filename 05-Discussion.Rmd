# Discussion

The data presented here suggest that the Rehmannii, Ramosa and Setacea groups of the Cape _Ehrharta_ each contain multiple species. In particular, there is evidence that each of the subspecies within the Rehmannii and Ramosa groups warrant species status, and that the Setacea group potentially contains up to eleven taxa. Here, I discuss the evidence for each species hypothesis, using the unified species concept of @Queiroz2007, which conceptualises a species as a separately evolving metapopulation-level lineage. The operational criteria used for developing species boundaries in this work are evidence of common ancestry inferred from phylogenetic analysis, evidence of genetic isolation inferred from genetic population assignment analysis (sNMF), and evidence of morphological and ecological differentiation. As such, this can be considered an integrative taxonomic approach, with multiple lines of evidence being used to delimit species boundaries. These operational criteria do not necessarily require a species to be monophyletic. Although it is a common taxonomic practice only to recognise monophyletic species, paraphyletic species are a likely outcome of some speciation models [@Funk2003; @Horandl2010]. For example, under peripatric speciation, a population on the periphery of a species' range differentiates to form a new species, thereby rendering the parent species paraphyletic relative to the newly-created daughter species  [@Mayr2002; @Crawford2010]. Although both taxa will eventually attain genetic monophyly, the rate at which this lineage sorting occurs depends on factors such as population size and the rate of within-species gene flow [@Rieseberg1994; @Funk2003]. Rather than the exception, it has been argued that peripatric speciation may be common in plants [@Rieseberg1994]. Therefore, should the two taxa be genetically, morphologically and/or ecologically distinct, it may should not be necessary either to sink the daughter species or to split the parent species simply for the purpose of enforcing species monophyly [@Crisp1995; @Horandl2010; @Kuchta2018; @Carnicero2019]. It is envisaged that the species hypotheses presented in this chapter will be formalized in a future taxonomic work, a full revision of the Ramosa, Rehmannii and Setacea clades of *Ehrharta* being outside the scope of the present study.

## Species hypotheses

### Rehmannii clade

Within the Rehmannii clade, three groups were recovered that correspond broadly to the three subspecies of _E. rehmannii_ and which can each justifiably be considered a species. While @GibbsRussell1989 considered the number of morphological intermediates between these groups to be too many to allow their distinction as species, the data presented in this study identify them as distinct. The phylogenetic analyses identify both the Filiformis and Subspicata groups as monophyletic and although the sNMF analyses provide some evidence of potential admixture in sites of sympatry, this is limited in scale and insufficient to erase their dominant genetic affinities. Moreover, a genetically-based PCoA resolves both as distinct clusters. The observation that admixture is limited even where these entities occur in sympatry, as at Pringle Bay (1590, 1591) where they form a mixed sward, indicates that they do not hybridize freely in nature and so constitute distinct biological species [@Britton2014]. Although Filiformis often grows on moist mountain slopes, it was also collected near coastal streams, in one locality in Pringle Bay (1591) growing interspersed with a Subspicata population (1590). Filiformis is also morphologically distinct from Subspicata, having finer leaves, finer culms and fewer spikelets, the latter also being held within rather than above the foliage. Finally, although the two species occur sympatrically at some sites, Filiformis most commonly inhabits damp sites on mountain slopes, while Subspicata typically associates with coastal sands. The distribution of the Filiformis group corresponds to that described in @GibbsRussell1989 for *E. rehmannii* subsp. *filiformis*, extending from the Cape Peninsula to Agulhas, while the distribution of the Subspicata group corresponds to that of *E. rehmannii* subsp. *subspicata*. Accession 1660, however, from a limestone pavement near De Hoop, is somewhat enigmatic. Based on its unique habitat and morphology, corresponding to the 'limestone' form of *E. rehmannii* subsp. *subspicata* described in @GibbsRussell1989, it is possible that this accession represents a distinct species. However, given its phylogenetic position embedded within Subspicata, and the sNMF analysis with K = 3 assigning this accession with nearly equal probability to the Subspicata and Filiformis clusters, I follow the recommendation of @GibbsRussell1989, and retain the accession within Subspicata until further sampling of the entity is conducted. Although the Rehmannii group is identified as monophyletic by only the ML analysis, the ASTRAL analysis resolving it as paraphyletic with respect to Filifiormis + Subspicata, the sNMF result identifies this entity as being genetically distinct under both K = 3 and K = 10. The evidence of admixture at Natureâ€™s Valley (1652) under K = 10 suggests that the group is genetically cohesive. Moreover, the LDA reveals Rehmannii to be morphologically distinct. Though similar to Subspicata, Rehmannii differs in being taller, in having larger inflorescences which also protrude higher above the foliage, and by its relatively shorter glumes. In addition, Rehmannii has a disjunct range, occurring from the Langeberg eastward to the Tsitsikamma Mountains, where it occurs primarily along the margins of Afrotemperate Forest patches.    

### Ramosa clade

The Ramosa clade shows evidence of three to five species. Although phylogenetic analysis reveals the existence of three principal groupings, the distinction of the Aphylla and Western Ramosa groups is unsupported by the sNMF analysis under K = 3. Rather, the sNMF analysis assigns these groups to a common gene pool and identifies only one of the Milner Peak populations (1624) as genetically distinct. Given the high levels of genetic disparity displayed shown by the Western Ramosa group (Fig. PCoA), however, it is likely that the sNMF analysis with K = 8 more accurately represents genetic structure within the Ramosa clade. The Aphylla group is especially well supported as a distinct species, being not only clearly monophyletic but also genetically cohesive, with the sNMF analysis under K = 8 assigning all individuals in this group to a single, exclusive gene pool. The Aphylla group is also morphologically divergent from the rest of the Ramosa clade, having spikelets with relatively longer glumes, longer leaves, fewer spikelets per inflorescence and often having striated sterile lemmas. The distribution range of this group as defined here is, however, more confined than that of _E. ramosa_ subsp. _aphylla_ of @GibbsRussell1989, consisting only of populations from the Cape Peninsula to Betty's Bay. 

The Eastern Ramosa group, which occurs along the Swartberg and Langeberg mountain ranges, is probably best treated as a single species since it is genetically coherent (Fig. PCOA) and can potentially be considered a species as it exhibits strong genetic similarity between populations (PCoA), and is recovered as monophyletic in the ASTRAL tree. Moreover, notwithstanding some evidence of potential admixture, the sNMF analysis with K = 3 assigns all Eastern Ramosa individuals with moderate probability to an ancestral gene pool that is absent from either the Aphylla or Western Ramosa groups. While at K = 8 the Langeberg accessions (1635, 1645) show little admixture, this may be an artefact of insufficient sampling density between their populations (Fig map, @ref). Although LDA based on morphology separates Eastern Ramosa from Western Ramosa with the misclassification of just a few individuals, there is no single trait which clearly distinguishes the Eastern Ramosa group from the rest of the Ramosa clade. 

Most challenging of all to delimit, the Western Ramosa group is widely distributed in the mountains of the western CFR, where it shows considerable genetic and morphological heterogeneity, and likely comprises of two or more species. Under K = 8, most populations are genetically distinct, even those collected in sympatry. For example, two accessions from Milner Peak (1622, 1624) showed no admixture, despite occurring within a few kilometres of each other, which suggests that they represent distinct biological species. Similarly, the sympatric accessions from Limietberg (1609, 1611) are not recovered as sisters in the phylogenetic analysis. The sampling density employed in this study is, however, insufficient to test the species limits of these potential taxa confidently [@Mason2020], and I therefore err on the side of caution and do not recommend splitting this complex further. Instead, I recommend that the Western Ramosa group be provisionally treated as a single species, since it is monophyletic in the ML analysis, and paraphyletic only with respect to the Aphylla group in the ASTRAL analysis. In addition, the LDA reveals that the Western Ramosa group is morphologically distinct from the other Ramosa groups.

### Setacea clade

@GibbsRussell1987b described two species and seven subspecies within the Setacea clade, the majority of which are found to be polyphyletic in this study. By contrast, the data presented here suggest that the Setacea clade potentially contains between nine and eleven species, largely corresponding to the groups recovered by the phylogenetic analyses. *Ehrharta rupestris* subsp. *rupestris* is found to consist of two well-supported lineages, the Eastern and Western Rupestris groups, which are not, however, resolved as sisters in the phylogenetic analyses. The well-supported monophyly of Western Rupestris, which comprises the type form of  *E. rupestris* subsp. *rupestris*, and its assignment by sNMF to a single, exclusive gene pool under K = 9,  strongly support its promotion to species status. The same is true for Eastern Rupestris, which corresponds to the smaller form of *E. rupestris* subsp. *rupestris* mentioned in @GibbsRussell1987b. The two Rupestris groups are, however, morphologically similar, the Eastern group having slightly finer leaves and culms. The ecology of the two is subtly different, with the Western Rupestris group occurring on the rocky summit ridges of the Riviersonderend and Langeberg mountains, and the Eastern Rupestris group generally being collected in moist depressions on north-facing slopes of the Klein and Groot Swartberg mountains.

The Uniflora group, corresponding to _E. setacea_ subsp. _uniflora_, had both a distinct genetic composition and a unique morphology, clearly showing that it is a species in its own right. The group is characterised by thin leaves and culms, with long-glumed, small spikelets. Similarly, the phylogenetic analysis shows that the Restioid Tricostata group forms a well-supported clade, with little admixture with groups also deemed in *E. rupestris* by @GibbsRussell1987b.  The Restioid Tricostata group has one of the most distinctive morphologies in the Rupestris clade, with clear separation in the LDA. Univariate analyses show that it is characterised by large internode distances, highly reduced pedicels, and sheaths that are long relative to leaf length. This group occurs in seeps from the Cape Peninsula to Hermanus. The Scabra group corresponds to of *E. setacea* subsp. *scabra*. Unexpectedly, a Scabra population from Marloth (1633) showed high levels of admixture with other groups at K = 9, particularly with the Leafy Tricostata gene pool, although at K = 19 this effect disappeared. However, there was very little admixture with the Marloth Setacea population (1633) that occurs in sympatry. In addition, due to its morphological distinctness, and monophyly recovered in the phylogenetic analysis, I recommend that the Scabra group be given species status. An accession originally identified as *E. rupestris* subsp. *tricostata* (1640) is recovered as sister to the remainder of the Scabra group, and corresponds to the Scabra individuals misclassified in the LDA plot. It is possible that this accession should not be included within the larger Scabra group, but as it was not included in the sNMF analysis, there is not enough evidence to justify the split.

There is also some evidence that the Fernkloof group recovered in the phylogenetic analysis may consist of two species. One of these potential species, called here Fernkloof A, would consist of *E. setacea* subsp. *disticha* accessions from Buffelstalberg (1589) and Fernkloof (1597, 1598),  and two other Fernkloof accessions, one a small statured accession that appeared to be an intermediate form between *E. setacea* subsp. *disticha* and *E. setacea* subsp. *setacea* (1599), and a larger form that had a creeping growth habit (1593). The other potential species, Fernkloof B, would consist of two accessions with a morphology similar to that of the Setacea group (1595 and 1600). The primary evidence to recognise these two groups a distinct species is that there appears to be little to no admixture between them, despite occurring in sympatry within the Fernkloof Nature Reserve. There is also evidence of morphological differentiation, as Fernkloof B has substantially longer spikelets, leaves, and thicker culms, in addition to some indication of ecological differentiation, with Fernkloof A collected on rocky slopes, and Fernkloof B in boggy depressions. 

The data also suggest that the Setacea group can be considered a species. The group consists of a monophyletic clade in the ASTRAL tree, and has stronger admixture and genetic similarity between populations than with other species groups. While its morphology is somewhat variable, and overlaps with that of the Fernkloof groups, it still forms a relatively cohesive cluster within the LDA. In particular, the group is distinguished by glumes of approximately the same length as the lemmas. The Setacea group is one of the most widespread in the Rupestris clade, occurring in moisture-rich habitats from the Cape Peninsula, to Limietberg and to Marloth. The Leafy Tricostata and Dodii groups share a similar morphology, mainly differing in the number of spikelets. Nonetheless, genetic data suggest that they are separate species, as they form separate monophyletic clades in the ASTRAL analysis, and a PCOA shows little genetic similarity between the two groups. Finally, the accession 1657, collected from Wemmershoek and initially identified as *E. rupestris* subsp. *tricostata*, is another potential species. Poorly resolved in the phylogenetic analysis, it shows no admixture with any other species groups, and has a morphology intermediate between that of the Setacea and Leafy Tricostata groups. 

##  Taxonomic crypsis of _Ehrharta_

The proposed species delimitation scheme increases the number of species in the Cape _Ehrharta_ by 13, from 22 to 35, with the number of species in the Rehmannii, Ramosa and Setacea clades together now nearly equaling that of the Lowlands clade. Of these, several are cryptic or semi-cryptic taxa. The Setacea clade was expected to show the greatest levels of cryptic diversity, owing to its general association with fragmented high-elevation habitats which foster non-adaptive divergence [@Verboom2015], yet many species in this clade are morphologically distinguishable. The Restioid Tricostata, Uniflora, and Scabra groups are easy to differentiate, implying some role for adaptive divergence in the diversification of this clade, while the Dodii/Leafy Tricostata and Eastern Rupestris/Western Rupestris species pairs might be better described as examples of semi-cryptic differentiation, as their morphological differences are subtle. The most striking example of true taxonomic crypsis in the Setacea clade is provided by the Setacea and Fernkloof B groups, which clearly genetically and phylogenetically distinct, but are nearly identical with respect to morphology and habitat preference. Perhaps more surprising is the high level of cryptic differentiation revealed within the Ramosa clade. Strong population-level genetic divergence within the Ramosa species implies that gene flow is limited, which is an unexpected result given the greater tolerance of Ramosa for arid conditions  [@GibbsRussell1989; @GibbsRussell1987b] and what this means for its ability to traverse the drier valleys between adjacent mountain ranges. It is unclear, however, whether the strong genetic structure observed within Ramosa is a function of the heterogeneous topography of the Cape, or of a biological characteristic, such as poor propagule dispersibility or limited seed output  compared to clonal growth [@van2004], which might compromise rates of gene flow. In the latter case, the observed pattern may represent strong isolation-by-distance, with the apparent genetic discontinuities between populations a function of insufficient sampling density [@Perez2018; @Mason2020].  

Cryptic species have been the object of considerable criticism, including that they are artefacts of new species concepts, that genetic data are insufficient to delimit distinct evolutionary units, and that delimiting cryptic species is contributing to taxonomic inflation, disrupting established taxonomy and hindering conservation efforts [@Tattersall2007; @Isaacs2004; @Mace2004; @Heller2013]. Consistent with these criticisms, it has been argued that morphology should be one of the primary characters for species delimitation, on the basis that it is a proxy for reproductive isolation [@Valdecasas2008; @refs], and that careful investigation will reveal morphological differences where the species delimitation is valid [@Korshunova2019]. Yet, not only can morphology be heavily influenced by environmental conditions, increasing the noisiness of its phylogenetic signal, but genetic data are a more direct measure of reproductive isolation [@Bernardo2011; @Lorenzen2008], and allow for a clearer understanding of the processes driving historical and contemporary speciation pattens [@Georges2018]. Nonetheless, in order to alleviate the fear that genetic data increases Type 1 error rate, where the rank of species is assigned to a population [@Cotterill2014], this study uses two lines of genetic evidence with difference resolutions to delimit species, which taken together, provide a robust picture of species boundaries. Few other studies have conducted such a geographically thorough, population-level genetic evaluation of species boundaries within the GCFR, notable exceptions being  the works of @Rymer2010, @Prunier2010, @Segarra2010, @Britton2014, @Lexer2014, @Prunier2017 and @Shaik2020. Of these studies, several have found evidence of cryptic species, suggesting that the GCFR may contain substantially more biodiversity than is currently appreciated, particularly within species-lineages that are widespread throughout the mid- and high-elevation zones.
