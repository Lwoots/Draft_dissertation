# What is driving speciation in the cape?

Lineage diversification is often accompanied by increased ecological diversity [@Givnish1997; @Givnish2015]. Known as adaptive radiation, this phenomenon is driven by ecological speciation, which occurs when barriers to gene flow evolve among populations due to ecologically-based divergent selection [@Schluter2009; @Rundle2005]. It has been widely used to explain the origin of species-rich lineages, including renowned radiations such as Darwin's finches [@Grant2008], African cichlids [@Seehausen2006], and Hawaiian silverswords [@Witter1988; @Givnish2009]. However, adaptive radiations are perhaps not as ubiquitous as previously thought, as it is now recognised that many radiation events require a more nuanced understanding [@Simoes2016; @Olson2009; @Losos2009]. A variety of both intrinsic and extrinsic triggers, such as climatic shifts, geographic uplift, pollinator-mediated isolation, dispersal ability, allopolyploidy and hybridisation, among others, are involved in determining whether a lineage undergoes a radiation event [@Bouchenak2015; @Wen2014]. Of particular interest in montane regions are geographic, or non-adaptive radiations, where diversification is triggered by a physical barrier [@Rundell2009; @Simoes2016]. Speciation in non-adaptive radiations is driven by neutral processes such as genetic drift, as the barrier restricts gene flow between populations, causing them to diverge via the random fixation of alleles [@Rundell2009]. The resulting taxa generally show little niche differentiation, and have allopatric or parapatric distributions [@Gittenberger1991; @CzekanskiMoir2019].   

Adaptive and non-adaptive radiation events are expected to leave different morphological and genetic patterns within their descendent lineages [@Gavrilets2009]. Due to the role of natural selection, lineages diversifying via adaptive radiation typically have substantial morphological variation, as well as elevated rates of morphological and genetic change [@Givnish2015]. Conversely, non-adaptive radiation events often result in species that are poorly morphologically differentiated, and that have approximately neutral rates of genetic evolution [@Rundell2009]. In order to distinguish between the two radiation types, rates of morphological change can compared between clades, either by hypothesising _a priory_ where a rate shift occurs in the tree [@OMeara2006] or by modelling potential shift locations [eg. @Eastman2011]. In addition, the strength and direction of natural selection between clades can be evaluated by comparing the ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions (dN/dS = $\omega$) in protein-coding genes [@Yang1998; @Bielawski2004]. A non-synonymous substitution is a mutation that changes an amino acid within a protein, and can therefore experience selection, while a synonymous substitution does not alter the protein, allowing their accumulation at the same rate as the overall genomic mutation rate [@Kimura1968]. However, determining $\omega$ is a non-trivial matter, as it can vary over time, between sites and between lineages [@Bielawski2013; @Yang2019]. 

Adaptive radiation via ecological speciation is undoubtedly an instrumental force in generating the high species richness of the GCFR. The rugged topography of the Cape provides strong environmental gradients, which together with fine-scale edaphic mosaics, promote adaption to local selection pressures, driving ecological shifts between closely related species [@Vanderniet2009]. Many of the iconic GCFR radiations, such as _Erica_, _Protea_, _Phylica_, _Muraltia_, _Pelargonium_ and Aizoaceae, are thought to have ecological components, whether that be shifts in climate or edaphic preference, pollinator syndrome or fire-survival strategy [@Richardson2001; @Forest2007b; @Schnitzler2011; @Klak2004; @Pirie2016; @Vanderniet2014]. However, early researchers in the Cape theorised that the mountains played an altogether different role in fostering speciation. @Adamson1958 and @Goldblatt1978 speculated that high elevation communities were relics of a previously widespead flora that contracted upslope in the face of an increasingly arid climate, resulting in vicariant species. Although later research found considerable variation in the timing of high-elevation divergence between Cape families, which contradicts the idea of a simultaneous vicariant speciation event [eg. @Linder2004; @Verboom2015], the hypothesis of non-adaptive speciation, driven by isolation-by-distance, in explaining high-elevation diversity has recently regained traction [@Verboom2015; @Britton2014; @Shaik2020]. Montane clades in the Cape often show strong allopatry and small ranges, with sister species occupying comparable ecological niches [@Verboom2015], which are characteristic of non-adaptive radiations [@Rundell2009]. Crucially, there is also evidence for diversification within ecologically-similar elevational bands, suggesting that factors other than ecological divergence are contributing to the species richness of the Cape [@Verboom2015]. Together with evidence of niche equivalency within clades [@Latimer2009], there is reason to believe that non-adaptive radiations have also played a role generating in the species richness of the GCFR. 

The Cape _Ehrharta_ is an ideal system in which to investigate elevation-specific drivers of diversification in the GCFR. The Lowlands clade experienced accelerated speciation during the Late Miocene. The rapid radiation had a strong ecological component, associated with the lineage's transition into the Succulent Karoo. While the early lineages of the Cape _Ehrharta_ are restricted to Table Mountain sandstone, Succulent Karoo taxa have adapted to a variety of soils, including granite (_E. barbinodis_ and _E. pusilla_), coastal dunes (_E. villosa_) and shale (eg. _E. melicoides_ and _E. eburnea_). As expected in an adaptive radiation, the Lowlands clade exhibits substantial trait variation, particularly in floral morphology, growth form, and life history [@Verboom2004; @GibbsRussell1987]. The Lowlands radiation was thought to be the only diversification event within the Cape _Ehrharta_, tying in with the narrative that the majority of GCFR radiations are based on ecological speciation [@Verboom2004]. However, this study provides evidence for multiple new species in the mid- and high-elevation Ramosa and Setacea clades, which suggests that there may have been more than one diversification event in the Cape _Ehrharta_. The cryptic nature of the new species hints at the possibility of a non-adaptive radiation driven by geographic isolation on the archipelagic peaks of the Cape Fold mountains.  

The aim of this chapter is to uncover whether different processes are driving diversification events in the low- and high-elevation regions of the GCFR, using the Cape _Ehrharta_ as a model system. I present a dated, species-level phylogenetic hypothesis of the Cape _Ehrharta_ , and to use this as a framework for estimating and comparing rates of diversification,  $\omega$, and phenotypic evolution between high-, mid- and low-elevation clades. It is hypothesized is that stronger population isolation paired with a more uniform selective regime increases the influence of neutral processes as a driver of differentiation at high elevations. As such, I predict lower rates of phenotypic evolution and lower $\omega$ in the high-elevation Setacea clade relative to the Ramosa and Lowlands clades.
