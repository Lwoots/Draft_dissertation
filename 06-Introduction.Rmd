# What is driving speciation in the cape?

Lineage diversification is often accompanied by an increase in ecological diversity [@Givnish1997; @Givnish2015], with speciation arising as a consequence of ecologically-based divergent selection [i.e. “ecological speciation”; @Rundle2005; @Schluter2009]. Where this is the case, and diversification is substantial, a lineage may be said to have undergone an “adaptive radiation” (Schluter, 2000). Although adaptive radiation has been widely invoked to explain the diversity of species-rich lineages, including Darwin's finches [@Grant2008], African cichlids [@Seehausen2006], and Hawaiian silverswords [@Witter1988; @Givnish2009], it is increasingly recognised that not all radiations are adaptive, with many radiation events requiring a more nuanced understanding  [@Simoes2016; @Olson2009; @Losos2009]. Beyond adaptive divergence, a variety of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as climate change, geographic uplift, pollinator-mediated isolation, dispersal limitation, allopolyploidy and hybridisation, among others, have the potential to influence gene flow patterns and so determine whether a lineage is likely to radiate [@Bouchenak2015; @Wen2014]. Of particular interest in montane regions are geographic, or non-adaptive radiations [@Boucher2016; @Kadereit2004; @Verboom2015; @Ebersbach2017], in which diversification is triggered by a physical barriers to gene flow [@Rundell2009; @Simoes2016]. Speciation in non-adaptive radiations is a consequence of genetic divergence powered by neutral processes such as genetic drift, which play out when conspecific populations become isolated [@Rundell2009]. The resulting taxa generally show little niche differentiation, and have allopatric or parapatric distributions [@Gittenberger1991; @CzekanskiMoir2019].   

Adaptive and non-adaptive radiation events are expected to leave contrasting morphological and genetic signatures within their descendent lineages [@Gavrilets2009]. Owing to the role of natural selection, lineages diversifying via adaptive radiation typically have substantial morphological variation, as well as elevated rates of morphological and genetic change [eg @Givnish2015; @Givnish2009; @Lerner2011; @Schluter2009]. Conversely, non-adaptive radiation events often result in species that are poorly morphologically differentiated, and that have approximately neutral rates of genetic evolution [@Rundell2009; @ref]. For the purpose of distinguishing between the two radiation types, rates of morphological change can be quantified and compared between clades, either by hypothesising _a priori_ where a rate shift occurs in the tree [@OMeara2006], or by using model comparisons to locate rate shifts in a way that does not require any *a priori* hypothesis [eg. @Eastman2011]. In addition, the strength and direction of natural selection between clades can be evaluated by comparing the ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions (dN/dS = $\omega$) in protein-coding genes [@Yang1998; @Bielawski2004]. A non-synonymous substitution is a mutation that changes an amino acid within a protein, and can therefore experience selection, while a synonymous substitution does not alter the amino acid sequence and so is hidden from selection. Critically, where synonymous substitutions are expected to accumulate at the same rate as the overall genomic mutation rate [@Kimura1968; but see @Chamary2006], the rate of non-synonymous substitutions can be elevated or depressed by divergent and stabilising selection respectively, changing the value of $\omega$. However, determining $\omega$ is a non-trivial matter, as it can vary over time, between sites and between lineages [@Bielawski2013; @Yang2019]. 

Adaptive radiation and ecological speciation have undoubtedly played an important role in generating the high floristic richness of the GCFR. The rugged topography of the Cape underpins strong environmental gradients, which together with fine-scale edaphic mosaics, provide the context needed for local adaption and, potentially, ecological speciation [@Linder1985]. Ecological differentiation is thus frequent between closely related plant species [@Vanderniet2009], and many of the iconic GCFR radiations, including those of _Erica_, _Protea_, _Phylica_, _Muraltia_, _Pelargonium_ and Aizoaceae, are thought to have an ecological component, whether this involves shifts in climate or edaphic preference, pollinator syndrome or fire-survival strategy [@Richardson2001; @Forest2007b; @Schnitzler2011; @Klak2004; @Pirie2016; @Vanderniet2014]. Early researchers, however, envisaged an altogether different role for mountains in fostering diversification of the Cape flora. @Adamson1958 and @Goldblatt1978 speculated that high elevation plant communities were relics of a previously widespread flora that contracted into higher-elevation refuges in the face of an increasingly arid climate, thereby precipitating widespread vicariant speciation. Although variation in the timing of radiation between high-elevation lineages [e.g. @Linder2004; @Verboom2015] contradicts the idea of a synchronous vicariant speciation event, the hypothesis of non-adaptive speciation, driven by isolation-by-distance, in explaining high-elevation diversity has recently regained traction [@Verboom2015; @Britton2014; @Shaik2020]. Clades of montane plants in the Cape often show small and strongly allopatric ranges, with sister species occupying comparable ecological niches [@Verboom2015], which is characteristic of non-adaptive radiations [@Rundell2009]. Crucially, there is also evidence for diversification within ecologically-similar elevational bands, suggesting that factors other than ecological divergence are contributing to the species richness of the Cape [@Verboom2015]. Together with evidence of niche equivalency within clades [@Latimer2009], there is reason to believe that non-adaptive radiations have also played a role in generating the species richness of the GCFR. 

The Cape-centred _Ehrharta_ clade is an ideal system in which to investigate elevation-specific drivers of diversification in the GCFR. The Lowlands clade are believed to have experienced accelerated speciation during the Late Miocene, this radiation having a strong ecological component and being associated with the lineage's transition into the Succulent Karoo [@Verboom2003; @Verboom2004]. While the early lineages of the Cape _Ehrharta_ are restricted to Table Mountain sandstone, Succulent Karoo taxa have adapted to a variety of soils, including granite (_E. barbinodis_ and _E. pusilla_), coastal dunes (_E. villosa_) and shale (eg. _E. melicoides_ and _E. eburnea_). As expected in an adaptive radiation, the Lowlands clade exhibits substantial trait variation, particularly in floral morphology, growth form, and life history [@Verboom2004; @GibbsRussell1987]. The Lowlands radiation was considered to be the only diversification event within the Cape _Ehrharta_, tying in with the narrative that the majority of GCFR radiations are based on ecological speciation [@Verboom2004]. However, the present study provides evidence for multiple new species in the mid- and high-elevation Ramosa and Setacea clades (Chapter 2), which suggests that there may have been more than one diversification event in the Cape _Ehrharta_. Moreover, the cryptic to semi-cryptic nature of many of the putative new species delimited in Chapter 2 hints at the possibility of a non-adaptive radiation driven by geographic isolation on the archipelagic peaks of the Cape Fold mountains.  

The aim of this chapter, then, is to uncover whether different processes are driving diversification events in the low- and high-elevation regions of the GCFR, using the Cape _Ehrharta_ as a model system. Incorporating the sequence data generated in Chapter 2, I present a dated, species-level phylogenetic hypothesis of the Cape _Ehrharta_ , and to use this as a framework for estimating and comparing diversification rates,  $\omega$, and phenotypic evolution between high-, mid- and low-elevation clades. Following @Verboom2015, it is hypothesised that stronger population isolation paired with a more uniform selective regime increases the relative influence of neutral processes as a driver of differentiation at high elevations. As such, I predict lower rates of phenotypic evolution and lower $\omega$ in the high-elevation Setacea clade relative to those in the Ramosa and Lowlands clades.
