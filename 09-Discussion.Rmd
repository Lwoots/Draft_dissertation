The hypothesis that the Cape _Ehrharta_ has undergone an adaptive radiation at low elevations and a non-adaptive radiation at high elevations was not supported by the data. While there was some evidence for elevated diversification rate within the Setacea clade, there was little evidence for a shift in diversification rate associated with the transition to the Succulent Karoo in the Lowlands Clade. In addition, the rate of morphological change showed the opposite pattern to the expected, with elevated rates of change in _Setacea_, rather than in the Lowlands clade. Similarly, the strongest signal of positive selection was shown in the Setacea clade.

Establishing age estimates for lineages within Poaceae have been hindered by the scarcity of macrofossils [@Stromberg2011], leading @Prasad2011 to make use of phytolith microfossils in calibrating their tree of the rice tribe. The present study used the dates of @Prasad2011 as calibration, resulting in age estimates which, at 68 Myr for _Oryza_ - _Ehrharta_ and 20 Myr for _Ehrharta_ - _Microlaena_, are substantially older than previous estimates for the origin of _Ehrharta_. For example, @Hoffmann2015, @Vicentini2008 and @Bouchenak2010 dated the split between _Oryza_ and _Ehrharta_ at 25, 35 and 50 Ma respectively, while @Bouchenak2010 also estimated _Ehrharta_ - _Microlaena_ at approximately 10 Ma. The older date estimates with the @Prasad2011 calibrations are difficult to contextualise given the climatic history of the GCFR. The results place the origin of the Succulent Karoo clade during the Mid-Miocene, predating the onset of a summer-arid climate during the Pliocene [@Dupont2011], the erosion events that revealed the fertile shales of the Succulent Karoo [@Cowling2009], and the origin of the Succulent Karoo vegetation type itself [@Verboom2009]. Similarly, the moisture-loving Setacea clade would originate and diversify during the arid Pliocene. Rescaling the dates presented here with the age estimates of @Vicentini2008, @Bouchenak2010 and @Hoffmann2015 (Supp. Table rescaled_dates) would place the crown age of the Succulent Karoo clade between 10.6 and 5.3 Ma, coinciding with the origin of the Succulent Karoo flora, and the crown age of the Setacea clade between 3.7 and 1.9 Ma, coinciding with the cooler and wetter Pleistocene. Given the difficulty of assigning microfossils to a particular lineage [@Christin2014], and the lack of concordance with previous studies, the absolute dates in this work should perhaps be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, as the branch length relationships would remain the same regardless of their absolute time calibrations, changes in date estimates would not alter downstream analyses of morphological and molecular evolution.         

Overall, diversification occurred at a relatively constant rate across much of the Cape _Ehrharta_, with some evidence for an increase of diversification rate within the Setacea clade. This pattern held for both the trees constrained to the taxa in @Verboom2003, and with the inclusion of the taxa delimited in this study. Constant diversification is not consistent with findings by @Verboom2003 and @Hoffmann2015, who found a rapid increase in diversification rate leading to the Succulent Karoo clade. The conflicting result may either be an artefact of the stochasticity of DNA marker choice, as both @Verboom2003 and @Hoffmann2015 evaluated just two markers (ITS and trnL-trnF), or alternatively, by excluding the Australasian genera such as _Microlaena_ and _Tetrarrhena_, this study may have reduced power to detect rate shifts across the tree [eg. @Guyer1993; @Agapow2002]. However, constant or even decreasing diversification rate is a common phenomenon in the GCFR, with clades such as Restionaceae [@Linder2004; @Bouchenak2017] and _Leucadendron_ [@Hoffmann2015], showing a constant accumulation of lineages over time, while in others, such as _Protea_ and _Moraea_, diversification rate slows [@Schnitzler2011; @Hoffmann2015]. The pattern is generally attributed to low extinction rates [@Cowling2002; @Linder2005; @Linder2008; @Valente2010], potentially due to climatic buffering during the Pleistocene glacial cycles [@Colville2020; @Dynesius2000]. The western GCFR in particular, where the majority of Lowlands and Succulent Karoo taxa occur, has been stable for long periods of time [@Colville2020], potentially facilitating the slow and constant accumulation of species in the Lowlands clade. In the rest of the Cape _Ehrharta_ however, the apparent increase in rate of lineage proliferation in the lineage-through-time plot, together with the "broom and handle" shape of the phylogeny, suggest high extinction rates [@Nee1994; @Crisp2009], especially along the branches leading to the Setacea, Ramosa-Rehmannii and Dura clades. It is possible these lineages, of which almost all extant taxa, with the exception of those in the Ramosa clade, are moisture dependent, underwent substantial extinction during the Late-Miocene aridification.

Adaptive radiations are expected to result in lineages with high morphological variance between taxa, as the lineages differentiate to fill available niche space [@Schluter2000]. The Lowlands clade, predicted to display the strongest signature of adaptive evolution, did indeed show considerable trait variation, especially in comparison to the Setacea clade. Despite the difficulty of directly inferring a causal link between adaptive processes and trait variation [@Mitchell2015; @Reich2003], @Verboom2004 was able to show that the trait values in the Lowlands clade do indeed reflect adaptation to heterogeneous environmental conditions. This result is corroborated by elevated rates of functional trait evolution (leaf length, plant height, lemma length and spikelet size as a proxy for seed size) in the Lowlands clade in comparison to the rest of the tree, reflecting divergent selection on traits necessary for survival [@Cornelissen2003; @Jardine2020]. Conversely, the lower trait variation in the Ramosa-Rehmannii and Setacea clades is consistent with non-adaptive speciation [@Rundell2009]. Absolute trait variance however, does not take evolutionary time into account and young clades under strong selection may not have had enough time to differentiate, potentially hiding support for ecological speciation. The Setacea clade showed this pattern, with most traits exhibiting substantially faster rates of evolution than the rest of the tree, despite the clade's low trait variance. In contrast, the Ramosa-Rehmannii clade had a striking pattern of slow rates for almost all traits in comparison to the rest of the tree, suggesting that either neutral or stabilising selection has the strongest influence on this clade.  

None of the clades were evolving under positive selection ($\omega$ > 1), which, as the branch models used find the average rate of $\omega$ across all sites [@Yang2007] and the loci incorporated are likely to be conserved [@Johnson2019], is perhaps not unexpected. However, it is still informative to compare $\omega$ between clades in order in evaluate relative strength of selection [@Delatorres2017; @Buschiazzo2012]. The Setacea clade contained the highest value of $\omega$ (Setacea clade $\omega$ = 0.23, background $\omega$ = 0.18), and therefore showed the strongest evidence for divergent selection amongst the clades. Although this is contradicts the hypothesis of non-adaptive speciation in the high-elevations, it corroborates with the elevated rate of trait evolution in the clade. The value of  $\omega$ was also greater in the Ramosa-Rehmannii clade in comparison to the rest of the tree ($\omega$ = 0.21vs  $\omega$ = 0.19), although given the suppressed rate of trait evolution in the clade, this may be an artefact of a large positive outlier corresponding to Eastern Ramosa (Fig. free_ratios). The Lowlands clade showed a higher rate of molecular evolution than the Setacea and Ramosa-Rehmannii clades, as shown by the greater values of dS and dN, possibly due to the shorter generation time of the annuals in the clade [@Smith2008rates]. Yet, unexpectedly given the evidence for adaptive radiation, $\omega$ had the lowest value in the Lowlands clade. While it is possible that there has been very little divergent selection within the clade, and that the observed trait variance is due to neutral divergence over long periods of time, this seems unlikely given the affinity of Lowlands taxa to their local substrates [@Verboom2004]. Alternatively, the analyses used here are not sensitive or comprehensive enough to find evidence of divergent selection in the clade. For example, selection pressures act heterogeneously across the genome [@Wolf2009; @Kunstner2010], and the 44 loci used may not be representative of the genome as a whole. Additionally, divergent selection on just one or two amino acid sites can make a substantial difference to protein function, and this signal can lost using the average branch value of $\omega$ [@Yang2007; @Weadick2012].

The results therefore show that, while the type of radiation in the Cape _Ehrharta_ does vary between clades, speciation does not become progressively non-adaptive with elevation as hypothesised. The Lowlands clade does appear to have diversified via an adaptive radiation, with changes to life history (eg. annuals, geophytes) allowing access to arid environments previously unavailable to _Ehrharta_ [@Verboom2004]. It is not, however, an explosive radiation [@Givnish2015]. Rather, the Lowlands clade seems to have undergone gradual speciation over long periods of time as the lineages filled available niches, which, coupled with low extinction, has lead to the high diversity of the clade. In contrast, the mid-elevation Ramosa-Rehmannii clade is the radiation most likely to have been influenced by non-adaptive processes. The species in the Ramosa clade occur in similar habitats, consisting of dry, rocky slopes in the fynbos, which, together with very little morphological differentiation, suggests that ecological speciation has had minimal influence on their diversification. Instead, poor seed set (_pers. obs._), potentially limited dispersal and reliance on clonal reproduction may make the precipitous Cape mountains an effective barrier to gene flow in this group [@Givnish2010; @Kisel2010]. Similarly, although Rehmannii species have undergone ecological differentiation (eg. Subspicata occurring in coastal habitats), given the limited overlap in their distributions they may have first experienced non-ecological, allopatric speciation. Finally, the radiation of the high-elevation Setacea clade is almost certainly has a substantial ecological component, given the fast rates of morphological and genetic change, with the cryptic nature of many of the species potentially a result of a younger clade age. There also appears to be subtle ecological differentiation within the clade, for example the sympatric Fernkloof A and B species occurring on rocky slopes and damp hollows respectively. Many montane clades have undergone substantial diversification during the Pleistocene, as climate oscillations caused suitable habitat to expand and contract along mountain slopes, altering population connectivity [@Muellner2019; @Mairal2017; @Flantua2018].  While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact trigger of diversification in the Setacea clade given the uncertainty in the age estimates, it is possible that climate oscillations during the Pleistocene may have been a contributing factor.

The present work therefore contributes to a growing body of research that demonstrates that it is difficult to generalise what causes radiations, as each clade's unique history, together with a wealth of intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute differently to diversification [@Lago; @Muellner2019; @Simoes; @Bouchenak].

Need time estimates to unravel causes.

The only non-geophytic  harsh environment may require a particular morphology leading to cryptic species.

While elevated rates are consistent with ecological selection, although impossible to rule out plasticity. Interestingly, the traits that are considered functional (leaf length and width, height, spikelet size as a proxy for seed size), were evolving at a faster rate in Lowlands, and conserved in Setacea. It is possible that the smaller population sizes are causing drift on the less vital traits, while stabilising selection acts on the functional traits. the Ramosa-Rehmannii clade had a striking pattern of slow rates for almost all traits in comparision to the rest of the tree. Ramosa-Rehmannii tend to occur to drier, rocky habitats and poor fynbos soils, but with none of the aridity traits that are found in Lowlands (annuals, geophytes), potentially suggesting strong stabilising selection is necessary to survive inhospitable environment. Overall, the Lowlands clade did not display the elevated rate of trait evolution that is associated with many adaptive radiations, but given the slow diversification rates

  The Setacea clade

* Ramosa - Slow rates for everything - stabilising selection

All together, morphology results suggest that Lowlands and Setacea have experienced directional, ecological selection, while RR is experiencing stabilising or neutral selection
