The hypothesis that the Cape _Ehrharta_ has undergone an adaptive radiation at low elevations and a non-adaptive radiation at high elevations was not supported by the data. While there was some evidence for elevated diversification rate within the Setacea clade, there was little evidence for a shift in diversification rate associated with the transition to the Succulent Karoo in the Lowlands Clade. In addition, the rate of morphological change showed the opposite pattern to the expected, with elevated rates of change in _Setacea_, rather than in the Lowlands clade. Similarly, the strongest signal of positive selection was shown in the Setacea clade.

Establishing age estimates for lineages within Poaceae have been hindered by the scarcity of macrofossils [@Stromberg2011], leading @Prasad2011 to make use of fossilised phytolith micofossils in calibrating their tree of the rice tribe. This study used the dates of @Prasad2011 as calibration, resulting in age estimates which, at 68 Myr for _Oryza_ - _Ehrharta_ and 20 Myr for _Ehrharta_ - _Microlaena_, are substantially older than previous estimates for the origin of _Ehrharta_. For example, @Hoffmann2015 and @Vicenti2008 dated the split between _Oryza_ and _Ehrharta_ at 25 and 35 Ma respectively, while @Bouchenak estimated the split to be 50 Ma, and _Ehrharta_ - _Microlaena_ at approximately 10 Ma. The older date estimates with the @Prasad2011 calibrations are difficult to contextualise given the climatic history of the GCFR. For example, the results place the origin of the Succulent Karoo clade during the Mid-Miocene, predating the onset of a summer-arid climate during the Pliocene, the erosion events that revealed the fertile shales of the Succulent Karoo, and the origin of the Succulent Karoo vegetation type itself. Similarly, the moisture-loving Setacea clade would originate and diversify during the arid Pliocene. Rescaling the dates presented here with the age estimates of @Bouchenak, @Vicenti2008 and @Hoffmann2015 (Supp. Table rescaled_dates) would place the crown age of the Succulent Karoo clade between 10.6 and 5.3 Ma, coinciding with the origin of the Succulent Karoo flora, and the crown age of the Setacea clade between 3.7 and 1.9 Ma, coinciding with the cooler and wetter Pleistocene. Given the difficulty of assigning microfossils to a particular lineage [@Chistin2014], and the lack of concordance with previous studies, the absolute dates in this work should perhaps be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, as the branch length relationships would remain the same regardless of their absolute time calibrations, changes in date estimates would not alter downstream analyses of morphological and molecular evolution.         

Overall, diversification occurred at a relatively constant rate across much of the Cape _Ehrharta_, with some evidence for an increase of diversification rate within the Setacea clade. This pattern held for both the trees constrained to the taxa in @Verboom2003, and with the inclusion of the new taxa delimited in this study. Constant diversification is not consistent with findings by @Verboom2003 and @Hoffmann2015, who found a rapid increase in diversification rate leading to the Succulent Karoo clade. The conflicting results may either be artefact of the stochasticity of DNA marker choice, as both @Verboom2003 and @Hoffmann2015 evaluated just two markers (ITS and trnL-trnF), or alternatively, by excluding the Australasian genera such as _Microlaena_ and _Tetrarrhena_, this study may have reduced power to detect rate shifts across the tree [eg. @Guyer1993; @Agapow2002]. However, constant or even decreasing diversification rate is a common phenomenon in the GCFR, with clades such as Restionaceae [@Linder2004; @Bouchenak2016] and _Leucadendron_ [@Hoffmann2015], showing a constant accumulation of lineages over time, while in others, such as _Protea_ and _Moraea_, diversification rate slows [@Schnitzler2011; @Hoffmann2015]. The pattern is generally attributed to low extinction rates [@Linder2008; @Valente2010; Cowling2002], potentially due to climatic buffering during the Pleistocene glacial cycles [@Colville2020; @refs]. The western GCFR, where the majority of Lowlands and Succulent Karoo taxa occur, in particular has been stable for long periods of time [@Colville2020]. This may have facilitated the  slow and constant accumulation of species in the Lowlands clade. In the rest of the Cape _Ehrharta_ however, the apparent increase in rate of lineage accumulation in the lineage-through-time plot, together with the "broomstick" shape of the phylogeny, suggest high extinction rates (@Nee; @ref], especially along the branches leading to the Setacea clade. It is possible that the Setacea lineage, of which almost all extant taxa are moisture dependent, underwent substantial extinction during the Miocene aridification, and subsequently expanded and speciated during the wetter Pleistocene cycles.

A lack of shift doesn't disprove adaptive radiation, but a shift may disprove non-adaptive 

Kozak, cycling can generate rapid accumulation of non adaptive vicariant species



Despite little evidence for radiation events within the Cape _Ehrharta_, can still evaluate which processes are driving speciation. 

Adaptive radiations are expected to result in lineages with high morphological variance between taxa, as the lineages morphologically differentiate to fill available niche space [@Schulter2000]. The Lowlands clade, expected to display the strongest signature of adaptive evolution, did indeed show considerable trait variation, especially in comparison to the Setacea clade. Despite the difficulty of directly inferring a causal link between adaptive processes and trait variation [@Mitchell2015; @Reich2003], @Verboom2004 was able to show that the trait values in the Lowlands clade do indeed reflect adaptation to heterogeneous environmental conditions. Conversely, the lower trait variation in the Ramosa-Rehmannii and Setacea clades is consistent with non-adaptive speciation [@Rundell2009]. Absolute trait variance however, does not take evolutionary time into account and young clades under strong selection may not have had enough time to differentiate, potentially hiding support for ecological speciation. This may be the case for the Setacea clade, which showed substantially faster rates of trait evolution than the rest of the tree. While elevated rates are consistent with ecological selection, although impossible to rule out plasticity. Interestingly, the traits that are considered functional (leaf length and width, height, spikelet size as a proxy for seed size), were evolving at a faster rate in Lowlands, and conserved in Setacea. It is possible that the smaller population sizes are causing drift on the less vital traits, while stabilising selection acts on the functional traits. the Ramosa-Rehmannii clade had a striking pattern of slow rates for almost all traits in comparision to the rest of the tree. Ramosa-Rehmannii tend to occur to drier, rocky habitats and poor fynbos soils, but with none of the aridity traits that are found in Lowlands (annuals, geophytes), potentially suggesting strong stabilising selection is necessary to survive inhospitable environment.
