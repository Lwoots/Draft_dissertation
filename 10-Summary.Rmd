# Synthesis

The GCFR has been the subject of sustained taxonomic research for over 250 years [@Linnaeus1753], making it one of the most well-characterised biological hotspots in the world [@Joppa2011]. It is thought that <1% of the flora remains undiscovered in the Core Cape Region [@Treurnicht2017], although a comparable estimate has not been determined for the Extra Cape Flora [@Snijman2013]. Most taxonomic work conducted to date has, however, focused on morphologically-based characters for delimitation [@Treurnicht2017], consequently biasing species discovery towards morphologically diagnosable taxa, and undercounting cryptic species [@Adams2014]. The present study documents multiple new species at higher elevations, some of which are barely distinguishable with morphological characters, but are genetically distinct (Chapter 2). Should this be generally true for lineages of Cape plants, as is suggested by other recent discoveries of semi-cryptic or cryptic species @Britton2014 and @Shaik2020, it is possible that a significant portion of the montane Cape flora is yet to be described. In particular, species with large distributions spanning multiple mountain ranges are likely to contain hidden diversity [@Britton2014]. To locate and accurately delimit these hidden species complexes however, robust, integrative taxonomic practices need to be implemented which incorporate multiple sources of evidence [@Dayrat2005; @Padial2010]. Moreover, this study demonstrates the value of using genome-wide data at different resolutions. For example, the targeted enrichment dataset employed here, which consists of loci that are relatively conserved across the angiosperms [@Johnson2019], reveals the polyphyly of _E. setacea_ and _E. rupestris_ as currently defined, while the GBS dataset, consisting of neutral markers, was able to uncover genetic boundaries between closely related sympatric taxa (eg. at Fernkloof and Milner Peak). This work also reiterates the necessity of dense population-level sampling to gain confidence in hypothesised species limits [@Bernardo2011; @Singhal2019], especially in the southwestern GCFR, where strong genetic structure was found within the Ramosa clade.

The Cape Fold mountains have long been considered an influential force in driving diversification in the GCFR [@Linder1985]. The steep mountain slopes create strong environmental gradients, increasing potential niche space and allowing ecological speciation to occur [@Schwery2015; @Rundle2005]. Yet, the isolated peaks also form "sky islands" that promote non-ecological speciation [@Britton2014; @Rundell2009], prompting the hypothesis that the relative importance of ecological and non-ecological speciation may vary with elevation [@Verboom2015]. The present study however, fails to provide strong support for this hypothesis. Instead, speciation processes are found to be clade specific, with the radiation of each clade triggered by a distinct set of intrinsic and extrinsic factors [@Bouchenak2015]. For example, the Lowlands clade evolved a diversity of life histories that allowed the clade to radiate adaptively onto the varied substrates of the arid succulent karoo and renosterveld regions [@Verboom2004], while extrinsic barriers to gene flow likely played a more influential role in the radiation of the Ramosa-Rehmannii clade. *Ehrharta* is not alone in highlighting the complexity of plant radiations, especially in montane regions [@Muellner2019b; @Wen2014]. Other studies of montane taxa have similarly revealed drivers of radiation to be clade-specific  [@Bentley2014; @Lagomarsino2016], with the diversification of subgroups of *Saxifraga* in the Hengduan Mountains being variously modulated by the effects of key innovation, extrinsic opportunities, or a combination thereof [@Ebersbach2017]. It has also been shown that differing trait-environment associations, linked to different life histories, can provoke unique evolutionary responses in lineages that exist under the same environmental conditions [@Mitchell2015]. Together, these factors suggest that even if historical and environmental conditions are well known, as they are in the Cape [@Cowling2002; @Verboom2014; @Linder2015], without sufficient knowledge of the natural history of the lineage in question it is difficult to understand triggers of diversification.

Yet, despite the idiosyncratic nature of lineage diversification, montane regions contain a much greater proportion of the Earth's biodiversity than is expected given their relatively small global area [@Rahbek2019a], and the Cape mountains are no exception [@Cowling2002; @Thuiller2006]. This implies that there must be biome-level processes unique to these regions that facilitate the accumulation of species richness [@Rahbek2019b]. Current biogeographical hypotheses however, struggle to explain this phenomenon, with statistical models of large-scale patterns of species richness generally under-predicting montane diversity [@Rahbek2019a]. Nonetheless, a new framework, known as the 'mountain geo-biodiversity hypothesis' (MGH) has recently been proposed to explain montane species richness in the context of Tibeto‐Himalayan mountain region [@Mosbrugger2018], which could potentially be applied to the Cape Fold Mountains. The MGH takes a holistic approach to explaining species richness by intertwining biological, geological and historical factors, and states that there are three conditions which, if present in a given system, maximise regional montane biodiversity. These conditions are i) full elevational zonation (eg. lowland, montane and alpine zones), which provides for both local adaptation and the immigration of diverse pre-adapted lineages; ii) high-relief terrain, which functions to provide climatic refugia and to reduce migratory/dispersal distances under climate change; and iii) historical climatic fluctuations which create a 'species pump' effect in the context of high-relief terrain [@Mosbrugger2018; @Muellner2019]. The Cape Fold mountains meet at least the first two conditions as they have strong elevational, moisture and temperature gradients, and while the alpine zone is not as extensive as that of the Tibeto‐Himalayan region, high-elevation plants do require some tolerance of subzero conditions [@Manning2012]. In addition, there is evidence of refugia within the Cape Fold mountains, especially in the Kogelberg region [@Grant2007; @Linder2019].

The third condition of the MGH, that of fluctuating climate, perhaps applies less obviously to the GCFR. Glacial cycles during the Pleistocene had a large impact on global species dynamics, causing both wide-scale extinction and extensive radiations events [@Gill2009; @Willis2004; @Hughes2006]. In contrast, the Pleistocene climate of the Cape was relatively stable [@Dynesius2000], with the species richness of the GCFR being partially attributed to limited extinction during this time [@Cowling2002; @Linder2008; @Linder2015]. Nonetheless, climate-induced fluctuations in species distributions did occur [@Dynesius2000; @Scott2007; @Huntley2016], potentially at remarkably fine geographic scales [@Chase2019]. Given the poor dispersal ability of many Cape plants [@Goldblatt1997], this may have been sufficient to create 'flickering connectivity' between populations [@Flantua2018book], in which the migration of species up and down elevational bands in response to climate change alters the degree of population isolation [@Flantua2019; @Mairal2017]. Flickering connectivity is thought promote speciation via a recently proposed mixing-isolation-mixing (MIM) model of speciation [@He2019]. Here, speciation involves recurrent cycles of gene flow between genetically distinct populations followed by geographic isolation, until total genetic isolation eventually occurs [@He2019]. 

In the context of this study, the Setacea clade may be an example of the MIM model of speciation. Firstly, the near simultaneous origin of this clade's taxa suggests a large-scale climatic trigger, such as the onset of Pleistocene glacial cycles [@Richardson2001], rather than gradual divergence into new niche space as seen in the Lowlands clade. Secondly, there is some indication of past gene flow between taxa in the clade. For example, the short branch lengths and poor phylogenetic support in the ASTRAL tree are indicative of gene tree discordance [@Zhang2018; @Sayyari2017], which, among other causes, can be attributed to gene flow [@Solis2016; @Thom2018]. Additionally, there is evidence of interspecies admixture (eg. in the Fernkloof, Setacea, Leafy Tricostata groups), which is also suggestive of past gene flow [@Martin2013; @Qu2012]. These concepts need to be tested explicitly however, by modelling Pleistocene climate fluctuations and species connectivity at fine spatiotemporal scales [@Chase2019; @Flantua2019] and relating them to historical gene flow events [@Sousa2013; @Penalba2019]. The MIM model of speciation can result in the rapid accumulation of species in areas where transient geographical barriers allow cyclical patterns of population isolation and mixing [@He2019]. Should this be the case for the GCFR, the MIM may better explain the rapid diversification of many Cape clades during the Pleistocene than allopatric or ecological models of speciation alone [@Abbott2019], and should be assessed in conjunction with the MGH as a potential mechanism behind the montane biodiversity in the GCFR.
