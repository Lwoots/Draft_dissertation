## Summary of the work, and how it affects our understanding of the processes in the GCFR 

* Found multiple new species at higher elevations, some of which are morphologically indistinguishable, some are subspecies

  Affects GCFR in that still may be many undescribed species, particularly in the mountains

* Found that no sudden shift in diversification

  Supports notion that there's no special processes in GCFR, just longer time

* But Complex suite of geographic, historical and climatic act together

* Subtle patterns at fine phylogenetic scales 

* Shouldn't extrapolate downwards from broad scales 

  

The GCFR has been the subject of sustained taxonomic research for over 250 years [@Linneus], making it one of the most well-characterised biological hotspots in the world [@Joppa2011]. So much so that it is thought that there is only <1% of the flora, or ~100 species are left undiscovered [@Treurnicht2017]. Yet, much of the taxonomic work has focused on morphological characters for delimitation [@Treurnicht2017], potentially biasing species discovery towards morphologically diagnosable taxa, and undercounting cryptic species. This study found multiple new species at higher elevations, some of which were nearly morphologically indistinguishable from each other, but were genetically distinct (Chapter 2). Should this be true for other Cape clades, as has been found by @Britton2014 and @Shaik2020, it is possible that a significant portion of the montane Cape flora is still waiting to be discovered. In particular, species with large distributions across multiple mountain ranges are likely to contain hidden diversity. To locate these species however, robust, integrative taxonomic practices need to be implemented. This study showed the importance of having genome-wide data at different resolutions. For example, the targeted enrichment dataset , while the GBS dataset was able to reveal genetic boundaries between sympatric taxa (eg Fernkloof and Milner). It is also extremely important to have population level sampling, particularly in the Western GCFR, where gene flow appears particularly fragmented [@Prunier etc].

The Cape Fold mountains have always been cited as an influential force in driving the species richness of the GCFR [@ref]. The steep mountain slopes create strong environmental gradients, increasing potential niche space and allowing ecological speciation to occur. Yet, their isolated peaks form "sky islands" that promote non-ecological speciation, prompting the hypothesis that the relative importance of ecological and non-ecological speciation may vary with elevation. The present study however, did not find strong evidence to support this hypothesis. Instead, it was found  that speciation processes within a lineage were clade specific, with the radiation of each clade triggered by a distinct set of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. For example, the Lowlands clade evolved geophytic and annual life histories, intrinsic innovations for aridity that allowed the clade to radiate into the newly exposed substrates of the Succulent Karoo.  *Ehrharta* is not alone in highlighting the complexity of plant radiations, especially in montane regions. Other studies have found clade specific radiations within a lineage [@Ebersbach2017; @ref],  While it has also been shown that different lineages unique evolutionary responses to the same conditions. Scale - differences between biome and lineage level processes. Conclusionary sentence leading to next paragraph.

Nonetheless, montane regions globally are very biodiverse, suggesting that there must be processes unique to these regions. Yet, unsurprisingly given the complexity underlying individual radiations, theoretical frameworks have struggled to account for the elevated biodiversity, eg predicting half the Cape's richness. A new framework has recently been proposed for the Tibeto‐Himalayan mountain region, known as the 'mountain geo-biodiversity hypothesis' (MGH), which potentially could be applied to the Cape Fold Mountains. The MGH takes a holistic approach to explaining species richness by integrating biology, geological diversity and historical conditions, and states that three conditions have generated montane biodiversity. Firstly, the presence of lowland, montane and alpine zones create sharp environmental gradients, allowing both local adaptation to large niche space, and the immigration of pre-adapted lineages. The Cape mountains do have strong moisture gradients, and while don't have as extensive an alpine zone as the Tibeto‐Himalayan region, does require tolerance of subzero conditions and snow. Secondly, the MGH suggests high-relief terrain is needed to reduce migratory distance during climate changes, and to have refugia. Cape does have refugia. Finally, needs to have experienced climate fluctuations 

Mountains are important in Cape

Ecological speciation along environmental gradients

Non-ecological on peaks

Lead to hypothesis of elevation specific effects

We found clade specific instead

Evidence for different processes within a clade eg ebersbach

Combination of trait@Mitchell and historical factors - importance of holistic approach

Population sizes

Mountain geobiodiversity hypothesis recently proposed holistic approach 

What it is

Where it has been implemented

How cape fits into it



*Paragraph 4*

Cape considered stable through the Pleistocene. Compared to the rest of the world, this is true, but still some climate change



Can expain allopatric signatures even when clades diversify after mountain uplift, while buffering extinction through refugia [@Ebersbach2017] Plus MGH shows why delay 



* Makes lowland radiations more dramatic, 
* Emphasizes importance of ecological
* No cape specific causes
* Suggests that pleistocene cycles may be more important
* Importance of dating analyses





Underestimating cryptic montane diversity in the GCFR has repercussions for our understanding of the causes of diversification in the Cape flora. The species richness of the mid- and high elevation clades calls into question our understanding of the evolutionary history of _Ehrharta_. @Verboom2003 found that the species richness of the genus was generated from a single lineage within _Ehrharta_, that corresponding to the Lowlands clade, which underwent an adaptive radiation event within the Cape winter-rainfall zone in response to increased aridity and rainfall seasonality during Late-Miocene climate change [@Verboom2003; @Verboom2004]. Instead, the evidence presented here suggests that both the Setacea and Ramosa-Rehmannii clades have also undergone appreciable diversification. While the Lowlands clade shows clear trait optimisation in response to climatic and edaphic properties [@Verboom2004], neither the Setacea nor Ramosa clades show the trait disparity expected by an adaptive radiation (@Gavrilets2009).

How increased number of species affect our understanding of the cape flora



## What future studies should focus on

- High elevation taxa, especially widespread
- Need population-level genome wide, ideally at different resolutions - eg would have missed fernkloof species
