## Summary of the work, and how it affects our understanding of the processes in the GCFR 

* Found multiple new species at higher elevations, some of which are morphologically indistinguishable, some are subspecies

  Affects GCFR in that still may be many undescribed species, particularly in the mountains

* Found that no sudden shift in diversification

  Supports notion that there's no special processes in GCFR, just longer time

* But Complex suite of geographic, historical and climatic act together

* Subtle patterns at fine phylogenetic scales 

* Shouldn't extrapolate downwards from broad scales 

  

The GCFR has been the subject of sustained taxonomic research for over 250 years [@Linnaeus1753], making it one of the most well-characterised biological hotspots in the world [@Joppa2011]. It is thought that there is only <1% of the flora left undiscovered in the Core Cape regions [@Treurnicht2017], although that estimate has not been evaluated for the Extra Cape Flora [@Snijman2013]. Much of the taxonomic work however, has focused on morphological characters for delimitation [@Treurnicht2017], potentially biasing species discovery towards morphologically diagnosable taxa, and undercounting cryptic species [@Adams2014]. This study found multiple new species at higher elevations, some of which were nearly morphologically indistinguishable from each other, but were genetically distinct (Chapter 2). Should this be true for other Cape clades, as has been found by @Britton2014 and @Shaik2020, it is possible that a significant portion of the montane Cape flora is still waiting to be described. In particular, species with large distributions across multiple mountain ranges are likely to contain hidden diversity [@Britton2014]. To locate and accurately delimit these hidden species complexes however, robust, integrative taxonomic practices need to be implemented that incorporate multiple sources of evidence [@Dayrat2005; @Padial2010]. Additionally, this study showed the importance of having genome-wide data at different resolutions. For example, the targeted enrichment dataset, which consists of loci that are relatively conserved across the angiosperms [@Johnson2019], revealed the polyphyly of the Setacea clade, while the GBS dataset, consisting of neutral markers, was able to uncover genetic boundaries between closely related sympatric taxa (eg. at Fernkloof and Milner Peak). This work also reiterates the necessity of dense population-level sampling to gain confidence in hypothesised species limits [@Bernardo2011], especially in the western GCFR, which is characterised by small species distributions and limited gene flow [@ref].

The Cape Fold mountains have long been considered an influential force in driving diversification in the GCFR [@ref]. The steep mountain slopes create strong environmental gradients, increasing potential niche space and allowing ecological speciation to occur [@ref]. Yet, the isolated peaks also form "sky islands" that promote non-ecological speciation [@ref], prompting the hypothesis that the relative importance of ecological and non-ecological speciation may vary with elevation [@Verboom2015]. The present study however, did not find strong evidence to support this hypothesis. Instead, it was found that speciation processes within a lineage were clade specific, with the radiation of each clade triggered by a distinct set of intrinsic and extrinsic factors [@Bouchenak2015]. For example, the Lowlands clade evolved geophytic and annual life histories, intrinsic innovations for aridity that in turn allowed the clade to radiate into the varied substrates of the Succulent Karoo [@Verboom2004], while in the Ramosa-Rehmannii clade, extrinsic barriers to gene flow likely played an influential role in the clade's radiation. *Ehrharta* is not alone in highlighting the complexity in the triggers of plant radiations, especially in montane regions [@Muellner2019b; @ref]. Other studies have also found clade-specific drivers of radiation within a lineage [@Lagomarsino2016], for example subgroups of *Saxifraga* diversified either due to key innovations or extrinsic opportunities in the Hengduan Mountains [@Ebersbach2017]. It has also been shown that differing trait-environment associations can provoke unique evolutionary responses in lineages that exist in the same environmental conditions [@Mitchell2015]. Together, these factors suggest that even if historical and environmental conditions are well known, as they are in the Cape [@refs], without sufficient natural history knowledge on the lineage in question, hard to quantify triggers of diversification.

Yet, despite the individualism of lineage diversification, montane regions are contain a much greater proportion of the Earth's biodiversity than is expected from their relatively small global area [@ref]. The Cape mountains are no exception, with mountain fynbos most biodiverse. This implies that there must be biome-level processes unique to these regions that facilitate the accumulation of species richness [@ref]. Yet, perhaps unsurprisingly given the complexity of processes underlying individual radiations, current biogeographical hypotheses struggle to explain this pattern [@Rahbek2019a]. Nonetheless, a new framework, known as the 'mountain geo-biodiversity hypothesis' (MGH) has recently been proposed to explain montane species richness in the context of Tibeto‐Himalayan mountain region [@Mosbrugger2018], which could potentially be applied to the Cape Fold Mountains. The MGH takes a holistic approach to explaining biodiversity patterns by intertwining biological, geological and historical factors, and states that there are three conditions that, if present, maximise regional montane biodiversity. These conditions are i) full elevational zonation (lowland, montane and alpine zones), ii) high-relief terrain with environmental gradients, and iii) historical climatic fluctuations.

all present to some degree in the fold mountains.Firstly, the presence of lowland, montane and alpine zones create sharp environmental gradients, allowing both local adaptation to large niche space, and the immigration of pre-adapted lineages. The Cape mountains meets this condition as they do have strong moisture and temperature gradients, and while there is not an as extensive an alpine zone as the Tibeto‐Himalayan region, does require high elevation plants to have a tolerance of subzero conditions. Secondly, the MGH suggests high-relief terrain is needed to reduce migratory distance during climate changes, and to have refugia. Cape does have refugia. Finally, needs to have experienced climate fluctuations 

Mountains are important in Cape

Ecological speciation along environmental gradients

Non-ecological on peaks

Lead to hypothesis of elevation specific effects

We found clade specific instead

Can expain allopatric signatures even when clades diversify after mountain uplift, while buffering extinction through refugia [@Ebersbach2017] Plus MGH shows why delay 



* Makes lowland radiations more dramatic, 
* Emphasizes importance of ecological
* No cape specific causes
* Suggests that pleistocene cycles may be more important
* Importance of dating analyses





Underestimating cryptic montane diversity in the GCFR has repercussions for our understanding of the causes of diversification in the Cape flora. The species richness of the mid- and high elevation clades calls into question our understanding of the evolutionary history of _Ehrharta_. @Verboom2003 found that the species richness of the genus was generated from a single lineage within _Ehrharta_, that corresponding to the Lowlands clade, which underwent an adaptive radiation event within the Cape winter-rainfall zone in response to increased aridity and rainfall seasonality during Late-Miocene climate change [@Verboom2003; @Verboom2004]. Instead, the evidence presented here suggests that both the Setacea and Ramosa-Rehmannii clades have also undergone appreciable diversification. While the Lowlands clade shows clear trait optimisation in response to climatic and edaphic properties [@Verboom2004], neither the Setacea nor Ramosa clades show the trait disparity expected by an adaptive radiation (@Gavrilets2009).

How increased number of species affect our understanding of the cape flora



## What future studies should focus on

- High elevation taxa, especially widespread
- Need population-level genome wide, ideally at different resolutions - eg would have missed fernkloof species
