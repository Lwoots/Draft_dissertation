Trait,Description
Plant height,Length from rhizome to inflorescence tip
Vegetation height,Length from rhizome to second highest leaf (ie excluding flag leaf)
Leaf width,Width at the widest point of a representative leaf
Leaf length,Length from base to tip of a representative leaf 
Sheath length,Length of sheath subtending measured leaf
Internode distance,"Length between two nodes, measured in lowest 3rd of specimen, unless other internodes judged more representative."
Culm diameter,Measured in lowest 3rd of specimen
Inflorescence length,Length of a representative inflorescence
Spikelet number ,Count of spikelets in a representative inflorescence
Pedicel length,
Glume length outer,Length from base of spikelet to the tip of outer glume
Glume length inner,Length from base of spikelet to the tip of inner glume
Spikelet width,"Measured a third of the way up the spikelet, just before the glumes flare. Glumes are included, except for spp. such as tricostata where the glumes are reduced"
Spikelet length,Length from the base of spikelet to the tip of longest lemma
Lemma length outer,"Length from base of spikelet with glumes removed, to tip of outer lemma"
Lemma length inner,"Length from base of spikelet with glumes removed, to tip of inner lemma"
Striation number,Count of striations on inner lemma
Relative sheath length,"Sheath length/Internode distance, measures extent to which the internode is enclosed by the sheath"
Relative leaf length,Leaf length/Sheath length
Glume enclosure,"Glume length outer/Spikelet length, measures the extent to which the glume encloses the spikelet"
Glume ratio,"Glume length outer/Glume length inner, measures the equality of the glume lengths"
Spikelet shape,Spikelet length/Spikelet width
Lemma ratio,"Outer lemma length/Inner lemma length, measures the equality of the lemma lengths"
Inflorescence position,"Plant height/Veg height, measures extent to which the inflorescence extends above the foliage"
