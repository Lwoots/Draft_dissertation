	Abstract = {Several recent estimates of global biodiversity have concluded that the total number of species on Earth lies near the lower end of the wide range touted in previous decades. However, none of these recent estimates formally explore the real "elephant in the room", namely, what proportion of species are taxonomically invisible to conventional assessments, and thus, as undiagnosed cryptic species, remain uncountable until revealed by multi-gene molecular assessments. Here we explore the significance and extent of so-called "hyper-cryptic" species complexes, using the Australian freshwater fish Galaxias olidus as a proxy for any organism whose taxonomy ought to be largely finalized when compared to those in littlestudied or morphologically undifferentiated groups. Our comprehensive allozyme (838 fish for 54 putative loci), mtDNA (557 fish for 605 bp of cytb), and morphological (1963-3389 vouchers for 17-58 characters) assessment of this species across its broad geographic range revealed a 1500% increase in species-level biodiversity, and suggested that additional taxa may remain undiscovered. Importantly, while all 15 candidate species were morphologically diagnosable a posteriori from one another, single-gene DNA barcoding proved largely unsuccessful as an a priori method for species identification. These results lead us to draw two strong inferences of relevance to estimates of global biodiversity. First, hyper-cryptic complexes are likely to be common in many organismal groups. Second, no assessment of species numbers can be considered "best practice" in the molecular age unless it explicitly includes estimates of the extent of cryptic and hyper-cryptic biodiversity.},

	Abstract = {The taxonomic challenge posed by cryptic species (two or more distinct species classified as a single species) has been recognized for nearly 300 years, but the advent of relatively inexpensive and rapid DNA sequencing has given biologists a new tool for detecting and differentiating morphologically similar species. Here, we synthesize the literature on cryptic and sibling species and discuss trends in their discovery. However, a lack of systematic studies leaves many questions open, such as whether cryptic species are more common in particular habitats, latitudes or taxonomic groups. The discovery of cryptic species is likely to be non-random with regard to taxon and biome and, hence, could have profound implications for evolutionary theory, biogeography and conservation planning.},

	Abstract = {Aim Despite the accumulation of cases describing fast radiations of alpine plants, we still have limited understanding of the drivers of speciation in alpine floras and of the precise the timing of their diversification. Here, we investigated spatial and temporal patterns of speciation in three groups of alpine Primulaceae. Location Mountains of the European Alpine System. Methods We built a new phylogeny of Primulaceae including all species in three focal groups: Androsace sect. Aretia, Primula sect. Auricula and Soldanella. Combining phylogenetic information with a detailed climatic data set, we investigated patterns of range and ecological overlap between sister‐species using an approach that takes phylogenetic uncertainty into account. Finally, we investigated temporal trajectories of diversification in the three focal groups. Results We found that a large majority of sister‐species pairs in the three groups are strictly allopatric and show little differences in substrate and climatic preferences, a result that was robust to phylogenetic uncertainty. While rates of diversification have remained constant in Soldanella, both Androsace sect. Aretia and Primula sect. Auricula showed decreased diversification rates in the Pleistocene compared to previous geological epochs. Main conclusions Allopatric speciation with little niche divergence appears to have been by far the most common mode of speciation across the three groups studied. A few examples, however, suggest that ecological and polyploid speciation might also have played a role in the diversification of these three groups. Finally, extensive diversification likely occurred in the late Miocene and Pliocene coinciding with the later phases of the Alpine uplift, while diversification slowed down during subsequent glacial cycles of the Pleistocene.},

	Abstract = {[Display omitted] *Nr- and cp-DNA identify anciently-diverged lineages representing distinct species.*Weak morphological differentiation identifies these species as cryptic.*Species are largely allopatric, their ranges separated by low-elevation barriers.*Exaggerated morphological divergence in sympatry indicates intrinsic isolation.*Topography has played a key role in powering speciation in Tetraria triangularis. Since some speciation mechanisms are more likely to generate morphological disparity than others, the general failure of vascular plant taxonomists to recognize cryptic diversity may bias perceptions about speciation process in plants. While the exceptional floristic richness of the South African Cape has largely been attributed to adaptive divergence (`ecological' speciation), a combination of climatic dynamism and complex topography has likely provided ample opportunities for `non-ecological' vicariant speciation, a mechanism which is perhaps more likely to produce cryptic species. We explore the role of topography as a driver of `non-ecological' speciation in the high-elevation sedge Tetraria triangularis. Within this species, molecular and morphological data reveal five cryptic or semi-cryptic lineages of Miocene--Pliocene age which qualify as evolutionary species. At least three of these maintain their distinctness in sites of sympatry, identifying them as biological species. Negligible range overlap, and the identification of topography as a significant predictor of range turnover, identifies speciation as allopatric and a result of impeded gene flow across low-elevation topographic features. Weak morphological and ecological divergence implies a limited role for adaptive divergence in powering speciation, with character displacement in sympatry possibly arising as a consequence of interspecific competition. Although we cannot exclude a role for disruptive selection in species differentiation, we identify isolation of populations on topographically separated mountains as the principal motor of speciation. We suggest that the importance of topography in the genesis of Cape floristic diversity has been inadequately acknowledged.},

	Abstract = {Since nomenclature is intended to reflect the evolutionary history of organisms, advances in our understanding of historical relationships may lead to changes in classification, and thus potentially in taxonomic instability. An unstable nomenclature for medically important animals like venomous snakes is of concern, and its implications in venom/antivenom research and snakebite treatment have been extensively discussed since the 90´s. The taxonomy of the pitvipers of the Bothrops complex has been historically problematic and different genus-level rearrangements were proposed to rectify the long-standing paraphyly of the group. Here we review the toxinological literature on the Bothrops complex to estimate the impact of recent proposals of classification in non-systematic research. This assessment revealed moderate levels of nomenclatural instability in the last five years, and the recurrence of some practices discussed in previous studies regarding the use of classifications and the information provided about the origin of venom samples. We briefly comment on a few examples and the implications of different proposals of classifications for the Bothrops complex. The aim of this review is to contribute to the reduction of adverse effects of current taxonomic instability in a group of medical importance in the Americas. *Taxonomic instability may have implications in venom/antivenom research*The impact of nomenclatural changes in Bothrops in toxinological studies was estimated*We found moderate levels of nomenclatural instability in recent literature*We noted recurrence in practices regarding the use of classifications*The implications of different proposals of classifications for Bothrops are discussed},

	Abstract = {Comprising a land area of ca. 90,000 km , less than one twentieth (5%) the land area of the southern African subcontinent, the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) is, for its size, one of the world's richest areas of plant species diversity. A new synoptic flora for the Region has made possible an accurate reassessment of the flora, which has an estimated 9030 vascular plant species (68.7% endemic), of which 8920 species are flowering plants (69.5% endemic). The number of species packed into so small an area is remarkable for the temperate zone and compares favorably with species richness for areas of similar size in the wet tropics. The Cape region consists of a mosaic of sandstone and shale substrata with local areas of limestone. It has a highly dissected, rugged topography, and a diversity of climates with rainfall mostly falling in the winter months and varying from 2000 mm locally to less than 100 mm. Ecological gradients are steep as a result of abrupt differences in soil, altitude, aspect, and precipitation. These factors combine to form an unusually large number of local habitats for plants. Sandstone-derived soils have characteristically low nutrient status, and many plants present on such soils have low seed dispersal capabilities, a factor promoting localized distributions. An unusual family composition includes Iridaceae, Aizoaceae, Ericaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Proteaceae, Restionaceae, Rutaceae, and Orchidaceae among the 10 largest families in the flora, following Asteraceae and Fabaceae, as the most speciose families. Disproportionate radiation has resulted in over 59.2% species falling in the 10 largest families and 77.4% in the largest 20 families. Twelve genera have more than 100 species and the 20 largest genera contribute some 31% of the total species. Species richness of the Cape flora is hypothesized to be the result of geographic and parapatric radiation in an area with a mosaic of different habitats due to local soil, climate, and altitudinal differences that combine to produce steep ecological gradients. Also contributing to the diversity has been a relatively stable geological history since the end of the Miocene that saw the establishment of a semi-arid and extreme seasonal climate at the southwestern part of southern Africa.},

Many entomological studies rely on morphological identification of mosquitoes, limiting recognition to visually distinct species/species groups. Anopheles species assignments based on ribosomal DNA ITS2 and mitochondrial DNA COI were compared to morphological identifications from Luangwa and Nyimba districts in Zambia. The comparison of morphological and molecular identifications determined that interpretations of species compositions, insecticide resistance assays, host preference studies, trap efficacy, and Plasmodium infections were incorrect when using morphological identification alone. Morphological identifications recognized eight Anopheles species while 18 distinct sequence groups or species were identified from molecular analyses. Of these 18, seven could not be identified through comparison to published sequences. Twelve of 18 molecularly identified species (including unidentifiable species and species not thought to be vectors) were found by PCR to carry Plasmodium sporozoites - compared to four of eight morphological species. Up to 15% of morphologically identified Anopheles funestus mosquitoes in insecticide resistance tests were found to be other species molecularly. The comprehension of primary and secondary malaria vectors and bionomic characteristics that impact malaria transmission and intervention effectiveness are fundamental in achieving malaria elimination.},

	Abstract = {The diversity of life is one of the most striking aspects of our planet; hence knowing how many species inhabit Earth is among the most fundamental questions in science. Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts ~8.7 million ($\pm$ 1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which ~2.2 million ($\pm$ 0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86% of existing species on Earth and 91% of species in the ocean still await description. Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.},

During the past two decades we observed an exponential growth of publications on cryptic species. Recently published reviews have demonstrated cryptic species have profound consequences on many biological disciplines. It has been proposed that their distribution is non-random across taxa and biomes. We analysed a literature database for the taxonomic and biogeographical distribution of cryptic animal species reports. Results from regression analysis indicate that cryptic species are almost evenly distributed among major metazoan taxa and biogeographical regions when corrected for species richness and study intensity. This indicates that morphological stasis represents an evolutionary constant and that cryptic metazoan diversity does predictably affect estimates of earth's animal diversity.

	Abstract = {Radiations of ecologically and morphologically differentiated sympatric species can exhibit the pattern of a burst of diversification, which might be produced by ecological divergence between populations, together with the acquisition of reproductive isolation (`ecological speciation'). Here we suggest that this pattern could also arise if speciation precedes significant ecological differentiation (i.e. through geographical isolation and nonadaptive radiation). Subsequently, species ecologically differentiate and spread into sympatry. Alternative routes to producing ecologically differentiated sympatric species are difficult to detect in old radiations. However, nonadaptive radiations are common and might therefore regularly be responsible for currently ecologically differentiated sympatric species (e.g. among groups that are not susceptible to ecological speciation). Species evolving nonadaptively over long periods might eventually replace young, ecologically produced species.},

Any deviation from the typical activities of a species related to exophagy (feeding outdoors) and exophily (living and resting outdoors) (2) or to population replacement, followed by increased outdoor biting or resting (3), may undermine malaria control efforts. Identification of mosquitoes that transmit malaria parasites has, for the most part, relied on the use of outdated morphologic keys (4,5) and, more recently, species-diagnostic PCR (6). Cryptic species or subpopulations that exhibit divergent behaviors (7) may be responsible for maintaining malaria parasite transmission, and without adequate discriminatory techniques, these vectors may be misidentified and their key behavioral differences overlooked.},

	Abstract = {Cryptic species could represent a substantial fraction of biodiversity. However, inconsistent definitions and taxonomic treatment of cryptic species prevent informed estimates of their contribution to biodiversity and impede our understanding of their evolutionary and ecological significance. We propose a conceptual framework that recognizes cryptic species based on their low levels of phenotypic (morphological) disparity relative to their degree of genetic differentiation and divergence times as compared with non-cryptic species. We discuss how application of a more rigorous definition of cryptic species in taxonomic practice will lead to more accurate estimates of their prevalence in nature, better understanding of their distribution patterns on the tree of life, and increased abilities to resolve the processes underlying their evolution. Current definitions of cryptic species are inconsistent and can lead to biased estimates of species diversity. Cryptic species are often implied to represent taxa displaying low phenotypic disparity in relation to divergence time, but this relationship is usually not formally quantified. Here we propose a quantitative framework, which provides a formal characterization of the intuitive concept of cryptic species. The proposed framework facilitates understanding of evolutionary processes leading to and resulting from cryptic species and provides a basis for estimates and modeling of occurrences of cryptic species across taxa and environments. The framework fosters a shift from pattern- to process-driven research concerning cryptic species.},

	Abstract = {Cryptic species are detected at an ever‐increasing rate, mainly due to the application of molecular data. While the impact of this hidden diversity on macro‐ecology and conversation biology is widely recognized, its evolutionary significance is rarely. In recent years, it became apparent that definitions of cryptic species are too ambiguous to allow the differentiation between natural phenomena from human‐made artefacts. Hence, recently, a unifying conceptual framework has been proposed highlighting the necessity to test the degree of reduced phenotypic disparity in cryptic species. Within this reduced disparity also lies the evolutionary significance, as cryptic species can be regarded as the opposite of adaptive radiations. Specifically, studies on evolutionary stasis can substantially benefit from including these by addressing both patterns of reduced disparity and processes resulting in the lack of phenotypic evolution. In addition, this will allow connecting macro‐evolutionary and paleontological studies with micro‐evolutionary investigations of genotype‐phenotype linkage.},

Evolutionary inference can be complicated by morphological crypsis, particularly in open marine systems that may rapidly dissipate signals of evolutionary processes. These complications may be alleviated by studying systems with simpler histories and clearer boundaries, such as marine lakes---small bodies of seawater entirely surrounded by land. As an example, we consider the jellyfish Mastigias spp. which occurs in two ecotypes, one in marine lakes and one in coastal oceanic habitats, throughout the Indo-West Pacific (IWP). We tested three evolutionary hypotheses to explain the current distribution of the ecotypes: (H1) the ecotypes originated from an ancient divergence; (H2) the lake ecotype was derived recently from the ocean ecotype during a single divergence event; and (H3) the lake ecotype was derived from multiple, recent, independent, divergences. We collected specimens from 21 locations throughout the IWP, reconstructed multilocus phylogenetic and intraspecific relationships, and measured variation in up to 40 morphological characters. The species tree reveals three reciprocally monophyletic regional clades, two of which contain ocean and lake ecotypes, suggesting repeated, independent evolution of coastal ancestors into marine lake ecotypes, consistent with H3; hypothesis testing and an intraspecific haplotype network analysis of samples from Palau reaffirms this result. Phylogenetic character mapping strongly correlates morphology to environment rather than lineage (r=0.7512, p<0.00001). Considering also the deeper relationships among regional clades, morphological similarity in Mastigias spp. clearly results from three separate patterns of evolution: morphological stasis in ocean medusae, convergence of lake morphology across distinct species and parallelism between lake morphologies within species. That three evolutionary routes each result in crypsis illustrates the challenges of interpreting evolutionary processes from patterns of biogeography and diversity in the seas. Identifying cryptic species is only the first step in understanding these processes; an equally important second step is exploring and understanding the processes and patterns that create crypsis.},

	Abstract = {[Display omitted] *Phylogenomics reveals extensive paraphy in Schizothoracinae.*Convergent evolution of morphology prevails in Schizothoracinae.*Similar niches is the underlying mechanism of convergence.*Convergent evolution mislead taxonomy.*An overhaul of taxonomy of the HSG fishes is imperative. Highly specialized grade (HSG; genera Gymnocypris, Oxygymnocypris, Schizopygopsis, Platypharodon and Chuanchia) of the Schizothoracinae (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae) are endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Previously, two distinct ecomorphs were recognized according to trophic traits. One was a limnetic omnivore with normal lower jaw morphology, terminal mouth, and moderate or dense gill rakers, mostly inhabiting in open water of lakes, including Gymnocypris and Oxygymnocypris. Another was a benthic feeder with inferior mouth, sparse gill rakers and sharp horny sheath on the lower jaw for scraping of attached prey off hard substrates, including Schizopygopsis, Platypharodon and Chuanchia. However, traditional taxonomy of HSG based on these trophic traits presented extensive conflicts with the molecular studies in recent years. The possible cause could be convergent evolution in morphology, retention of ancestral polymorphisms or mitochondrial introgression, but these hypotheses could not be assessed due to incomplete taxon sampling and only mitochondrial data employed in previous works. Here, we conducted the most comprehensive molecular analysis on HSG fishes to date, using four mitochondrial loci and 152,464 genome-wide SNPs, and including 21 of 24 putative species and one undescribed Schizopygopsis species. Both SNP and mtDNA trees confirmed extensive paraphyly of genera Gymnocypris and Schizopygopsis, where species often were clustered together by watershed instead of by genus. Basal split into the north clade B and the south clade C (ca. 3.03 Ma) approximately by the Tanggula-Tanitawen Mountains in SLAF tree coincided with a violent uplift of the QTP during the phase A of `Qingzang movement' (ca. 3.6 Ma). Ancestral state reconstruction of the trophic ecomorph showed that the limnetic omnivore ecomorph had evolved repeatedly in clade B and C. Furthermore, we presented a striking case of convergent evolution between two `subspecies' Gymnocypris chui chui and G. chui longimandibularis, which had diverged as early as two million years ago (ca. 2.42 Ma). Ecological analyses revealed that similar food utilization, particularly in zooplankton, was the main underlying driving force. This work showed an example of taxonomy with the most extensive errors at the genus/species levels due to convergent evolution and suggested that trophic traits could be misleading in fish taxonomy. Therefore, we propose a major generic revision for HSG species.},

	Abstract = {Climatic and geological change may play a key role in stimulating biological radiations. Here, we use phylogenetic data to test whether the comparatively high diversity of ehrharteoid grasses in the Cape region of South Africa is the result of rapid radiation associated with the onset of a seasonally arid climate during the late Miocene. A phylogenetic hypothesis based on morphological and nucleotide sequence (nuclear ITS1 and plastid trnL-F) data confirms the monophyly of the African Ehrharta species and shows that the diversification of this lineage was centered in the Cape region. Sequence divergence data (ITS1 + trnL-F) indicate a pulse of rapid speciation, which may explain poor phylogenetic resolution within the African Ehrharta clade. Alternative calibrations yield a broad range of time estimates for the start and end of this radiation, most of which indicate a radiation inside the last 11 million years. A calibration based on the age of Ehrhartoideae suggests that radiation started 9.82 $\pm$ 0.20 million years ago and ended 8.74 $\pm$ 0.21 million years ago. Under alternative calibrations, estimated speciation rates during the period of radiation range between 0.87 and 4.18 species per million years. Parsimony optimization of habitat parameters reveals that radiation was correlated with the occupation of seasonally arid succulent karoo environments, wet heathy (fynbos) environments being ancestral. These data support earlier suggestions that late Miocene climatic change stimulated floristic radiation at the Cape, and highlight the potential importance of environmental change in powering diversification in continental floras.},

	Abstract = {The rugged topography of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), South Africa, is frequently invoked to explain the spectacular radiation of the Cape flora, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Where recent authors emphasize the importance of elevation gradients as stimuli for ecological speciation, earlier workers stressed the role of topography as an isolating mechanism, particularly in montane lineages. Using six Cape plant lineages, we tested whether elevation niches are phylogenetically conserved. We then assessed whether high-elevation species are more consistently range-restricted than low-elevation species, and whether high-elevation sisters show stronger range exclusivity (allopatry) and weaker ecological and phenotypic differentiation, suggestive of nonecological speciation. Elevation niches tend to be phylogenetically conserved. Also, high-elevation species are more consistently range-restricted than low-elevation species, potentially explaining the generally stronger range exclusivity of high-elevation sisters. While the high-elevation zone is less homogeneous ecologically, more data are required to demonstrate that high-elevation sister species show generally weaker ecological and phenotypic differentiation. Topographic complexity promotes geographical isolation at high elevations, thereby providing opportunities for nonecological, vicariant speciation. While recognizing the need for additional data, we suggest that the upland and lowland floras of the CFR may differ with regard to predominant speciation mode.},

	Abstract = {Phenotypic divergence is often unrelated to genotypic divergence. An extreme example is rapid phenotypic differentiation despite genetic similarity. Another extreme is morphological stasis despite substantial genetic divergence. These opposite patterns have been viewed as reflecting opposite properties of the lineages. In this study, phenotypic radiation accompanied by both rapid divergence and long‐term conservatism is documented in the inferred molecular phylogeny of the micro land snails Cavernacmella (Assimineidae) on the Ogasawara Islands. The populations of Cavernacmella on the Sekimon limestone outcrop of Hahajima Island showed marked divergence in shell morphology. Within this area, one lineage diversified into types with elongated turret shells, conical shells and flat disc‐like shells without substantial genetic differentiation. Additionally, a co‐occurring species with these types developed a much larger shell size. Moreover, a lineage adapted to live inside caves in this area. In contrast, populations in the other areas exhibited no morphological differences despite high genetic divergence among populations. Accordingly, the phenotypic evolution of Cavernacmella in Ogasawara is characterized by a pattern of long‐term stasis and periodic bursts of change. This pattern suggests that even lineages with phenotypic conservatism could shift to an alternative state allowing rapid phenotypic divergence.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Evolutionary biologists have often suggested that ecology is important in speciation, in that natural selection may drive adaptive divergence between lineages that inhabit different environments. I suggest that it is the tendency of lineages to maintain their ancestral ecological niche (phylogenetic niche conservatism) and their failure to adapt to new environments which frequently isolates incipient species and begins the process of speciation. Niche conservatism may be an important and widespread component of allopatric speciation but is largely unstudied. The perspective outlined here suggests roles for key microevolutionary processes (i.e., natural selection, adaptation) that are strikingly different from those proposed in previous literature on ecology and speciation. Yet, this perspective is complementary to the traditional view because it focuses on a different temporal stage of the speciation process.},

This evolution includes gradual trends of warming and cooling driven by tectonic processes on time scales of 10 5 to 10 7 years, rhythmic or periodic cycles driven by orbital processes with 10 4 - to 10 6 -year cyclicity, and rare rapid aberrant shifts and extreme climate transients with durations of 10 3 to 10 5 years. Here, recent progress in defining the evolution of global climate over the Cenozoic Era is reviewed. We focus primarily on the periodic and anomalous components of variability over the early portion of this era, as constrained by the latest generation of deep-sea isotope records. We also consider how this improved perspective has led to the recognition of previously unforeseen mechanisms for altering climate. 1 Earth Sciences Department, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, USA. 2 Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT 06459, USA. 3 Center for the Study of Global Change, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520-8105, USA. 4 College of Marine Studies, University of Delaware, Lewes, DE 19958, USA. *    To whom correspondence should be addressed.
